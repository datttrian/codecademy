# Off-Platform Project: Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts

In this project, you’ll build a simple website for a fictional arts and
crafts store using the tools on your own computer. This project will
provide you with less guidance than previous projects. You should expect
to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter
a problem that you cannot easily solve.

At a high-level, this project will require the following:

1.  A folder structure that makes sense for the project
2.  An HTML file
3.  A CSS file

To successfully complete the project, you’ll require the following
images:

1.  <a
    href="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/pattern.jpeg"
    class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image 1</a>
2.  <a
    href="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/hacksaw.jpeg"
    class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image 2</a>
3.  <a
    href="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/frames.jpeg"
    class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image 3</a>
4.  <a
    href="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/finnish.jpeg"
    class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image 4</a>

The rest of the page’s styling (font sizes, colors, etc.) is outlined in
the following design spec, which is a standard document you’d expect to
receive as a freelance web developer:

-   <a
    href="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/dasmotos-arts_redline.jpg"
    class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spec</a>

Use the website to the right and the resources above to guide you
through the project.
