# Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet

#### Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus
far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project
contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project
you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill
all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet,
Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you
cannot easily solve.

#### Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to
help you build more websites in the future! Although there are great
places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for
yourself is often your own notes and projects.

#### Setup Instructions

If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy,
you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button
below. If you need help setting up your computer, read our

## Prerequisites

1\.

To complete this project, you should have completed the codecademy
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">Introduction to HTML</a> course through the HTML tables
lesson, and lessons in
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">Learn CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules</a>.

## Project Requirements

2\.

Your project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic. In our <a
href="https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/html-css-cheat-sheet/example/index.html"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">example project</a>, we documented the
tags and attributes used in HTML tables layouts, but you can choose any
HTML or CSS topic that you’ve learned so far—the sky is the limit!

Possible topics could be:

- HTML Tables
- Other HTML tags
- CSS selectors and specificity
- Common CSS properties

If you choose to document HTML tags, open the hint to see how to include
HTML tags as text in your code.

3\.

Your site uses HTML tables to display the documentation. Be sure to
label the columns in your HTML.

In our example site, we used tables with columns for:

- The tag or attribute name
- The actual formatted tag (eg. `<table>`)
- A description of what to use the tag for.

You can use these same columns or choose your own.

4\.

Your site should utilize a custom color scheme. You can use any of the
<a href="http://www.colors.commutercreative.com/grid/"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">named CSS colors</a>.

5\.

Your site should use custom styles for any code such as HTML tags (like
`<h1>`) or CSS properties or values (like `font-family`). Represent code
using a <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family#Examples"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">monospace</a> font family and a different
background color.

## Solution

6\.

Great work! Visit <a
href="https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/build-your-own-cheatsheet-challenge-project-html-css/462393"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forums</a> to compare your project to
our sample solution code. You can also learn how to host your own
solution on GitHub so you can share it with other learners!

Your solution might look different from ours, and that’s okay! There are
multiple ways to solve these projects, and you’ll learn more by seeing
others’ code.

If you’d like to extend your cheat sheet, keep adding new topics to it
as you continue to learn more HTML, CSS, and more. As you become more
advanced with CSS, you’ll also be able to improve the styling and layout
of the cheat sheet itself.
