# The Summit

Time to put some navigation design knowledge to the test! Your goal is
to improve the user experience of this ski lodge landing page.
Currently, none of the clickable elements are very clear or offer good
visual feedback to users.

The exact implementation and styling will be up to you; take the
opportunity to be creative in your designs! Keep in mind that slick
styling is cool, but it is just as important to clearly demonstrate to
users how to interact with the site. We’ll provide some hints along the
way if you’re stuck.

If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced
developer work through it, click “**Get Unstuck**“ to see a **project

### Instructions

Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off

## Basic link styling

1\.

The site has basic styles laid out in **starting.css**. We’ve provided a
blank **style.css** file for writing your own styles with less clutter,
but feel free to write your CSS in whichever file you want. You
shouldn’t need to edit the **index.html** file, but you can reference it
and make changes if you need to. Before you begin, take a look through
**index.html** to get acquainted with the site structure.

Start by creating some basic link color highlighting and hover state
styling for all `<a>` tags. Open the hint below if you want to see how
we implemented our styles. Throughout, we’ll provide examples of one
possible way to implement the styling task, but there are essentially
unlimited possible ways to solve each task!

2\.

Style the `.nav-link` elements at the top of the page so that they show
clickability. These elements represent the main site navigation. Because
they are internal links, don’t necessarily need to look the same as the
external links in the description below.

## Styling buttons

3\.

Style the main “get on the mountain” button. This button can be selected
with the `.btn` class. It is up to you whether to opt for a more
skeuomorphic or flat design, or whether you want to try to blend between
the two. Start by doing a basic button style, we’ll get to `:hover` and
`:active` styles in the next step.

Our implementation uses a different font from the headings which has
been loaded into the workspace. Feel free to use this declaration if you
want to follow suit: `font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;`

4\.

Now, create `:hover` and `:active` styles for the `.btn` class. As you
add styles, continue testing in the browser to make sure you’re creating
clear visual feedback. Remember, you can alter all sorts of CSS
properties such as text `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`,
`border` properties, and much more.

You can also use
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS transitions</a> to ease between style
states—this is optional but can help make more seamless, animated
effects.

## Activity buttons

5\.

Now it’s time to show clickability for the large activity buttons at the
bottom of the page. These buttons already look a *little* like buttons,
as they are square and have basic text, but they don’t show any
clickability.

These buttons can be targeted by class with the `.activity` selector.
Begin by showing their clickability. This is also your chance to alter
or update their basic styling if you’d like to take a more skeuomorphic
design approach.

6\.

Now, create hover and active states. As before, make sure you are
demonstrating good visual feedback to show the different states.
