# Challenge Project: Build a Website Design System

#### Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus
far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project
contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project
you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill
all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet,
Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you
cannot easily solve.

#### Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be building your own basic design system for a
website. In essence, you’ll be building a website to help you build MORE
websites in the future! On your site, you’ll collect all the colors,
fonts, and some of the repeating styles.

#### Setup Instructions

If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy,
you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button
below. If you need help setting up your computer, read our

## Prerequisites

1\.

To complete this project, you should have completed the Codecademy
lessons covering the <a

concepts like flexbox, CSS grid, or responsive design, but they won’t be
required.

## Project Requirements

2\.

In this project, you’ll build a style guide/design system for your
website. Developers and designers use design systems in order to
organize the look and feel of a website or web application. Design
systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components
of a large website.

As your websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set
of styles will help them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users! It also
helps as you start working with other developers, as you can have a
consistent reference for how your website should be built.

Your style guide/design system will include at least a section on
colors, fonts, and specific text styles, but it can be extended to as
many other areas as you’d like. You can take a look at our <a
href="https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/website-design-system/example/index.html"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">basic example site</a> for a taste of
what you’ll be building (yours will be customized).

3\.

Your style guide should include a labeled section outlining the colors
to be used.

Each color should have:

- A name (you can come up with this name yourself)
- A box displaying the color itself.
- The CSS value used to create the color (in hex, `rgb()`, `rgba()`,
  `hsl()`, or `hsla()`).
- An optional description of how you intend to use the colors.

4\.

Your style should include a labeled section of the fonts to be used (we
recommend importing fonts from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Fonts</a>).

For each font, the goal is to to demonstrate the various styles that you
intend to use (font weight, style, size, and text decorations). To do
this, you should include the following for every font:

- The font name
- A series of styles that you intend to use (for example, styles could
  include: plain, bold and italic, underlined).
- For each style, include a sentence or series of words to demonstrate
  the text style (our example site uses <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog"
  class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">the quick brown fox…</a>).

Make sure to display each of the sections in the proper font, size, and
style.

5\.

In addition to the list of possible fonts, your style guide should
include a section for specific text styles for page elements. For
example, you could set main heading (`<h1>`) guidelines about text size,
fonts, font styles, font weight, and more.

Include at least 3 element styles, and ideally as many as you’d like to
use in future sites.

For each page element, include:

- A page element name (for example, “Subheading”).
- All style rules (for example, font-weight: 700).

6\.

Add any additional styles that you’d like to include to make your style
guide/design system look great. This could include positioning, layout,
additional colors, box model properties, and more.

class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">our forums</a> to compare your project to
our sample solution code. You can also learn how to host your own
solution on GitHub so you can share it with other learners! Your
solution might look different from ours, and that’s okay! There are
multiple ways to solve these projects, and you’ll learn more by seeing
others’ code.

If you’d like to extend your site, consider:

- Adding additional components (you could document the various
  <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/"
  class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">buttons</a> that you’d like to use).
- Learning how and then implementing a

  class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
  target="_blank">responsive design</a> so that your site looks great on
  all screen sizes.
- Adding navigation and splitting up your site so that each section has
  its own HTML page.
