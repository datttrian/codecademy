# JavaScript: All the Cool Kids Are Doing It

Why is JavaScript so popular? What can you do with it?

When the Internet boomed in the 1990s, technology companies battled to
build the most powerful and efficient web browser on the market. This
sparked the first “browser war,” between Microsoft (Internet Explorer)
and NetScape (NetScape Navigator) to gain dominance in the usage share
of web browsers.

Netscape needed a lightweight scripting language for easier programming
which ultimately made web development more accessible, unlike other
languages that required deeper training. In 1995, a NetScape employee,
Brendan Eich, was given ten days to help build the company a lightweight
scripting language. As a result, Eich built Mocha, which was later
renamed JavaScript. The moral of the story – JavaScript was never
intended to become the standard language for the web! However, as
NetScape won the browser war, the popularity of JavaScript grew. More
and more sites began using JavaScript, and those that didn’t eventually
had to as most developers used JavaScript to make websites.

JavaScript is now an essential web technology that’s supported by major
web browsers. The language is crucial for anyone who wants to
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/web-development"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">become a web developer</a>. Many experts agree that
JavaScript will continue to grow as an indispensable language for web
development.

### JavaScript on the Web

JavaScript, also called JS, is a flexible and powerful language that is
implemented consistently by various web browsers, making it the language
for web development. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are the core components
of web technology. While HTML is responsible for structure and CSS is
responsible for style, JavaScript provides interactivity to web pages in
the browser.

### Popularity of JavaScript

At this point, you may be wondering: how is it that a language written
in 10 days by one guy became mass-adopted by the world wide web? In
short, JavaScript became a hit because it turned web browsers into
application platforms. Here’s how:

1.  JavaScript can be used in both the front-end and back-end of web
    development.
2.  JavaScript is standardized so it’s frequently updated with new
    versions.
3.  JavaScript integrates easily with HTML and CSS.
4.  JavaScript allows websites to have interactivity like scroll
    transitions and object movement. Modern browsers still compete to
    process JavaScript the fastest for the best user experiences.
    Chrome, <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers#/media/File:StatCounter-browser-ww-monthly-201707-201707-map.png"
    class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most used Internet browser in
    2017</a>, has been so successful because of its ability to process
    JavaScript quickly.
5.  JavaScript offers a wide range of frameworks and libraries that help
    developers create complex applications with low overhead.
    Programmers can import libraries and frameworks in their code to
    augment their application’s functionality.

### JavaScript for Servers

In the early 2000s, big platforms like Facebook and Google began using
JavaScript in their back-end server logic to process and respond to
front-end requests. JavaScript helped businesses scale since engineers
who knew JavaScript could apply those skills in a back-end context.

JavaScript used for servers, also known as server-side JavaScript,
gained popularity because it allowed for scalability. In the server,
JavaScript can be integrated with other languages to communicate with
databases.

Node.JS, or Node, is one of the most popular versions of server-side
JavaScript. Node has been used to write large platforms for NASA, eBay
and many others. Since Javascript can execute programs out of sequential
order, Node can be used to create scalable web applications, messaging
platforms, and multiplayer games. This is why Google Cloud and Amazon
Web Service depend on Node for some of their services.

### What Else Can JavaScript Do?

Beyond the web, JavaScript has a large presence amongst cross-platform
applications. We use some popular standalone desktop apps like Slack,
GitHub, Skype, and Tidal. These applications are developed with the
JavaScript framework called <a href="https://electronjs.org/apps"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electron.js</a>. Electron is excellent
for making desktop applications that need to work across different
devices regardless of operating system.

In addition, JavaScript has the potential of expanding into other
innovative technologies such as virtual reality and gaming. JavaScript
can be used for animating, rendering and scaling. JavaScript even has
contributed to the internet of things, the technology that makes simple
objects, like your fridge, smarter. Everyday devices can become
interactive and collect data using JavaScript libraries.

### Conclusion

When diving into either programming or web development, JavaScript is an
excellent language to learn. The capabilities of JavaScript allow you to
use it in many different fields. Mastering what is known as “vanilla” or
plain JavaScript will help you to tackle more complicated frameworks and
libraries to make you a competitive developer. Take some of our

# JavaScript Versions: ES6 and Before

Ever heard of the term “ES6” and wondered what it’s about? Read this
article and find out!

You might have seen the term “ES6” or “Javascript ES6” and wondered what
it actually means. Well wonder no further, because we’re going to dive
into what ES6 is and how it relates to Javascript!

First, let’s bring in some history. JavaScript was introduced in 1995 by
the company Netscape Communications as a scripting language for web
designers and programmers to interact with web pages. The next year,
Netscape submitted JavaScript to a standards developing organization
called Ecma International to create standards for a scripting language
(a type of programming language). In 1997, Ecma International released
ECMA-262 which sets standards for the first version of a scripting
language called ECMAScript, shortened to ES.

These new ECMAScript standards provided rules for the architecture of
JavaScript features. As new programming paradigms emerged and developers
sought new features, newer versions of ECMAScript provided a basis for
consistency between new and old JavaScript versions.

To fully distinguish the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript:
if you want to create an app or program you can use JavaScript — if you
want to create a new scripting language you can follow the guidelines in
ECMAScript. So, when you see ES6 or JavaScript ES6, it means that that
version of JavaScript is following the specifications in the sixth
edition of ECMAScript! You might also see ES2015 instead of ES6, but
both terminologies are referring to the same 6th edition of ECMAScript
that was released in 2015. Take a look at the timeline below to see how
JavaScript has evolved over the years:

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-article-assets/javascript_timeline.svg"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="Timeline showing the evolution of JS editions from inception to 2018" />

Now, you may be asking, what makes an update in 2015 still relevant
today when there are more recent updates like ES7 and ES8?

Well, despite the release of newer versions, ES6 is actually the biggest
update made to ECMAScript since the first edition released in 1997! Some
developers even refer to ES6 as “Modern JavaScript” because of all the
major additions. There were so many great features added to help
JavaScript developers that include:

- new keywords like `let` and `const` to declare variables,
- new function syntax using Arrow functions,
- creation of Classes,
- parameters with default values,
- promises for asynchronous actions,
- and many more!

Up-to-date browsers now support most of the ES6 features which allow
developers to take advantage of these new additions. ES6 ultimately
allows programmers to save time and write more concise code. As with all
ES6 features, there are other underlying benefits and tradeoffs to
consider. Nonetheless, there has been a strong adoption of ES6 in the
development community. One big ES6 benefit is the ease it allows for
utilizing a popular programming paradigm, Object-Oriented Programming
(OOP). This change allowed for developers of other languages who are
used to OOP can now transition into learning and using JavaScript.
Another reason for the popularity of ES6 is correlated with the usage of
ES6 in popular frameworks like React. So, if you want to learn the
newest tools and frameworks, you will have to pick up ES6 along the way.

This being said, you shouldn’t disregard legacy code, i.e. older
versions of JavaScript. In fact, there are still many projects that are
built and maintained with legacy code! If you want the ability and
freedom to work on any sort of JavaScript project, you should
familiarize yourself with pre-ES6 and ES6 JavaScript syntax. But don’t
worry, we cover both pre-ES6 and ES6 in our JavaScript course. Check it
out to become a rockstar at JavaScript basics and learn fundamental
programming skills!

# Introduction to JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

Last year, millions of learners from our community started with
JavaScript. Why? JavaScript is primarily known as the language of most
modern web browsers, and its early quirks gave it a bit of a bad
reputation. However, the language has continued to evolve and improve.
JavaScript is a powerful, flexible, and fast programming language now
being used for increasingly complex web development and beyond!

Since JavaScript remains at the core of web development, it’s often the
first language learned by self-taught coders eager to learn and build.
We’re excited for what you’ll be able to create with the JavaScript
foundation you gain here. JavaScript powers the dynamic behavior on most
websites, including this one.

In this lesson, you will learn introductory coding concepts including
data types and built-in objects—essential knowledge for all aspiring
developers. Make sure to take notes and pace yourself. This foundation
will set you up for understanding the more complex concepts you’ll
encounter later.



Move to the next exercise when you’re ready to begin.

## Console

The console is a panel that displays important messages, like errors,
for developers. Much of the work the computer does with our code is
invisible to us by default. If we want to see things appear on our
screen, we can print, or *log*, to our console directly.

In JavaScript, the `console` keyword refers to an object, a collection
of data and actions, that we can use in our code. Keywords are words
that are built into the JavaScript language, so the computer recognizes
them and treats them specially.

One action, or method, that is built into the `console` object is the
`.log()` method. When we write `console.log()` what we put inside the
parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console.

It’s going to be very useful for us to print values to the console, so
we can see the work that we’re doing.

``` js
console.log(5); 
```

This example logs `5` to the console. The semicolon denotes the end of
the line, or statement. Although in JavaScript your code will usually
run as intended without a semicolon, we recommend learning the habit of
ending each statement with a semicolon so you never leave one out in the
few instances when they are required.

You’ll see later on that we can use `console.log()` to print different
kinds of data.



**1.**

Use the `console.log` code in the editor to log your age to the console.

Run your code when you are ready to see the result.

**2.**

On the next line, write another `console.log` to print out a different
number representing the number of weeks you’ve been programming.



``` javascript
console.log(45);
console.log(56);
```

    ## 45
    ## 56

## Comments

Programming is often highly collaborative. In addition, our own code can
quickly become difficult to understand when we return to it— sometimes
only an hour later! For these reasons, it’s often useful to leave notes
in our code for other developers or ourselves.

As we write JavaScript, we can write <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/comments?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">comments</a> in our code that the computer will ignore
as our program runs. These comments exist just for human readers.

Comments can explain what the code is doing, leave instructions for
developers using the code, or add any other useful annotations.

There are two types of code comments in JavaScript:

1.  A *single line comment* will comment out a single line and is
    denoted with two forward slashes `//` preceding it.

    ``` js
    // Prints 5 to the console
    console.log(5);
    ```

    You can also use a single line comment to comment after a line of
    code:

    ``` js
    console.log(5);  // Prints 5 
    ```

2.  A *multi-line comment* will comment out multiple lines and is
    denoted with `/*` to begin the comment, and `*/` to end the comment.

    ``` js
    /*
    This is all commented 
    console.log(10);
    None of this is going to run!
    console.log(99);
    */
    ```

    You can also use this syntax to comment something out in the middle
    of a line of code:

    ``` js
    console.log(/*IGNORED!*/ 5);  // Still just prints 5 
    ```



**1.**

Let’s practice adding some code comments.

To the right, we’ve provided you with the beginning of the book
*Catch-22* by Joseph Heller.

On line 1, write a single line comment that says `Opening line`.

**2.**

Single line comments are great for adding context to your code.
Multi-line comments are often best suited to prevent a block of code
from running. However, both types of comments can be used for either
purpose.

Use a multi-line comment so that the bottom 6 `console.log()` statements
are all commented out.



``` javascript
// Opening line
console.log('It was love at first sight.');
/*
console.log('The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.');
console.log('Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice.');
console.log('The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn\'t quite jaundice.');
console.log('If it became jaundice they could treat it.');
console.log('If it didn\'t become jaundice and went away they could discharge him.');
console.log('But this just being short of jaundice all the time confused them.');
*/
```

    ## It was love at first sight.

## Data Types

<a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/data-types?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">Data types</a> are the classifications we give to the
different kinds of data that we use in programming. In JavaScript, there
are seven fundamental data types:

- *Number*: Any number, including numbers with decimals: `4`, `8`,
  `1516`, `23.42`.
- *String*: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters,
  numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: `' ... '`
  or double quotes `" ... "`, though we prefer single quotes. Some
  people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.
- *Boolean*: This data type only has two possible values— either `true`
  or `false` (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on
  and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.
- *Null*: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value,
  and is represented by the keyword `null` (without quotes).
- *Undefined*: This data type is denoted by the keyword `undefined`
  (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it
  has a different use than `null`. `undefined` means that a given value
  does not exist.
- *Symbol*: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique
  identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about
  these for now.
- *Object*: Collections of related data.

The first 6 of those types are considered *primitive data types*. They
are the most basic data types in the language. *Objects* are more
complex, and you’ll learn much more about them as you progress through
JavaScript. At first, seven types may not seem like that many, but soon
you’ll observe the world opens with possibilities once you start
leveraging each one. As you learn more about objects, you’ll be able to
create complex collections of data.

But before we do that, let’s get comfortable with strings and numbers!

``` js
console.log('Location of Codecademy headquarters: 575 Broadway, New York City');
console.log(40);
```

In the example above, we first printed a string. Our string isn’t just a
single word; it includes both capital and lowercase letters, spaces, and
punctuation.

Next, we printed the number 40, notice we did not use quotes.



**1.**

On line 1, log the string `'JavaScript'` to the console.

**2.**

On line 2, log the number `2011` to the console.

**3.**

On line 3, print `'Woohoo! I love to code! #codecademy'` to the console.

**4.**

On line 4, print the number `20.49` to the console.



``` javascript
console.log('JavaScript');
console.log(2011);
console.log('Woohoo! I love to code! #codecademy');
console.log(20.49);
```

    ## JavaScript
    ## 2011
    ## Woohoo! I love to code! #codecademy
    ## 20.49

## Arithmetic Operators

Basic arithmetic often comes in handy when programming.

An <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/operators?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">operator</a> is a character that performs a task in our
code. JavaScript has several built-in *arithmetic operators*, that allow
us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers. These include the
following operators and their corresponding symbols:

1.  Add: `+`
2.  Subtract: `-`
3.  Multiply: `*`
4.  Divide: `/`
5.  Remainder: `%`

The first four work how you might guess:

``` js
console.log(3 + 4); // Prints 7
console.log(5 - 1); // Prints 4
console.log(4 * 2); // Prints 8
console.log(9 / 3); // Prints 3
```

Note that when we `console.log()` the computer will evaluate the
expression inside the parentheses and print that result to the console.
If we wanted to print the characters `3 + 4`, we would wrap them in
quotes and print them as a string.

``` js
console.log(11 % 3); // Prints 2
console.log(12 % 3); // Prints 0
```

The remainder operator, sometimes called *modulo*, returns the number
that remains after the right-hand number divides into the left-hand
number as many times as it evenly can: `11 % 3` equals 2 because 3 fits
into 11 three times, leaving 2 as the remainder.



**1.**

Inside of a `console.log()`, add `3.5` to your age.

This is the age you’ll be when we start sending people to live on Mars.

**2.**

On a new line write another `console.log()`. Inside the parentheses,
take the current year and subtract `1969`.

The answer is how many years it’s been since the 1969 moon landing.

**3.**

Create another `console.log()`. Inside the parentheses divide `65` by
`240`.

**4.**

Create one last `console.log()`. Inside the parentheses, multiply
`0.2708` by `100`.

That’s the percent of the sun that is made up of helium. Assuming we
could stand on the sun, we’d all sound like chipmunks!



``` javascript
console.log(10 + 3.5)
console.log(2022 - 1969);
console.log(65 / 240);
console.log(0.2708 * 100);
```

    ## 13.5
    ## 53
    ## 0.2708333333333333
    ## 27.08

## String Concatenation

Operators aren’t just for numbers! When a `+` operator is used on two
strings, it appends the right string to the left string:

``` js
console.log('hi' + 'ya'); // Prints 'hiya'
console.log('wo' + 'ah'); // Prints 'woah'
console.log('I love to ' + 'code.')
// Prints 'I love to code.'
```

This process of appending one string to another is called <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/strings?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank"><em>concatenation</em></a>. Notice in the third example
we had to make sure to include a space at the end of the first string.
The computer will join the strings exactly, so we needed to make sure to
include the space we wanted between the two strings.

``` js
console.log('front ' + 'space'); 
// Prints 'front space'
console.log('back' + ' space'); 
// Prints 'back space'
console.log('no' + 'space'); 
// Prints 'nospace'
console.log('middle' + ' ' + 'space'); 
// Prints 'middle space'
```

Just like with regular math, we can combine, or chain, our operations to
get a final result:

``` js
console.log('One' + ', ' + 'two' + ', ' + 'three!'); 
// Prints 'One, two, three!'
```



**1.**

Inside a `console.log()` statement, concatenate the two strings
`'Hello'` and `'World'`.

Note: You should concatenate the two strings exactly (without
introducing any additional characters).

**2.**

We left off the space last time. Create a second `console.log()`
statement in which you concatenate the strings `'Hello'` and `'World'`,
but this time make sure to also include a space (`' '`) between the two
words.



``` javascript
console.log('Hello' + 'World');
console.log('Hello'+ ' ' + 'World');
```

    ## HelloWorld
    ## Hello World

## Properties

When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the
browser saves it as an instance of the data type. All data types have
access to specific properties that are passed down to each instance. For
example, every string instance has a property called <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/strings/length"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank"><code
class="code__2rdF32qjRVp7mMVBHuPwDS">length</code></a> that stores the
number of characters in that string. You can retrieve property
information by appending the string with a period and the property name:

``` js
console.log('Hello'.length); // Prints 5
```

The `.` is another operator! We call it the *dot operator*.

In the example above, the value saved to the `length` property is
retrieved from the instance of the string, `'Hello'`. The program prints
`5` to the console, because `Hello` has five characters in it.



**1.**

Use the `.length` property to log the number of characters in the
following string to the console:

    'Teaching the world how to code'



``` javascript
console.log('Teaching the world how to code'.length);
```

## Methods

Remember that <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/methods?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">methods</a> are actions we can perform. Data types have
access to specific methods that allow us to handle instances of that
data type. JavaScript provides a number of string methods.

We *call*, or use, these methods by appending an instance with:

- a period (the dot operator)
- the name of the method
- opening and closing parentheses

E.g. `'example string'.methodName()`.

Does that syntax look a little familiar? When we use `console.log()`
we’re calling the `.log()` method on the `console` object. Let’s see
`console.log()` and some real string methods in action!

``` js
console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); // Prints 'HELLO'
console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H')); // Prints true
```

Let’s look at each of the lines above:

- On the first line, the `.toUpperCase()` method is called on the string
  instance `'hello'`. The result is logged to the console. This method
  returns a string in all capital letters: `'HELLO'`.
- On the second line, the `.startsWith()` method is called on the string
  instance `'Hey'`. This method also accepts the character `'H'` as an
  input, or *argument*, between the parentheses. Since the string
  `'Hey'` does start with the letter `'H'`, the method returns the
  boolean `true`.

You can find a list of built-in string methods in the <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/prototype"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript documentation</a>. Developers
use documentation as a reference tool. It describes JavaScript’s
keywords, methods, and syntax.



**1.**

Use the `.toUpperCase()` method to log the string `'Codecademy'` to the
console in all capital letters.

**2.**

In the second `console.log()` statement in **app.js**, we have a string
`' Remove whitespace '` which has spaces before and after the words
`'Remove whitespace'`.

If we browse the <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/prototype"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript string documentation</a>, we
find several built-in string methods that each accomplish a different
goal. The one method that seems ideal for us is `.trim()`.

Use the method to remove the whitespace at the beginning and end of the
string in the second `console.log()` statement.



``` javascript
// Use .toUpperCase() to log 'Codecademy' in all uppercase letters
console.log('Codecademy'.toUpperCase());

// Use a string method to log the following string without whitespace at the beginning and end of it.
console.log('    Remove whitespace   '.trim());
```

    ## CODECADEMY
    ## Remove whitespace

## Built-in Objects

In addition to `console`, there are other <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">objects built into JavaScript</a>. Down
the line, you’ll build your own objects, but for now these “built-in”
objects are full of useful functionality.

For example, if you wanted to perform more complex mathematical
operations than arithmetic, JavaScript has the built-in `Math` object.

The great thing about objects is that they have methods! Let’s call the
`.random()` method from the built-in `Math` object:

``` js
console.log(Math.random()); // Prints a random number between 0 and 1
```

In the example above, we called the `.random()` method by appending the
object name with the dot operator, the name of the method, and opening
and closing parentheses. This method returns a random number between 0
(inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

To generate a random number between 0 and 50, we could multiply this
result by 50, like so:

``` js
Math.random() * 50;
```

The example above will likely evaluate to a decimal. To ensure the
answer is a whole number, we can take advantage of another useful `Math`
method called `Math.floor()`.

`Math.floor()` takes a decimal number, and rounds down to the nearest
whole number. You can use `Math.floor()` to round down a random number
like this:

``` js
Math.floor(Math.random() * 50);
```

In this case:

1.  `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1.
2.  We then multiply that number by `50`, so now we have a number
    between 0 and 50.
3.  Then, `Math.floor()` rounds the number down to the nearest whole
    number.

If you wanted to see the number printed to the terminal, you would still
need to use a `console.log()` statement:

``` js
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 50)); // Prints a random whole number between 0 and 50
```

To see all of the properties and methods on the `Math` object, take a
look at <a

target="_blank" rel="noopener">the documentation here</a>.



**1.**

Inside of a `console.log()`, create a random number with
`Math.random()`, then multiply it by `100`.

**2.**

Now, use `Math.floor()` to make the output a whole number.

Inside the `console.log()` you wrote in the last step, put the existing
`Math.random() * 100` code inside the parentheses of `Math.floor()`.

**3.**

Find a method on the <a

the smallest integer greater than or equal to a decimal number.

Use this method with the number `43.8`. Log the answer to the console.

**4.**

Use the <a

target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript documentation</a> to find a
method on the built-in `Number` object that checks if a number is an
integer.

Put the number `2017` in the parentheses of the method and use
`console.log()` to print the result.



``` javascript
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100));
console.log(Math.ceil(43.8));
console.log(Number.isInteger(2017));
```

## Review

Let’s take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:

- Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays
  messages, with `console.log()`.
- We can write single-line comments with `//` and multi-line comments
  between `/*` and `*/`.
- There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers,
  booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
- Numbers are any number without quotes: `23.8879`
- Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes:
  `'Sample String'`
- The built-in arithmetic operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.
- Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties,
  stored information. The properties are denoted with a `.` after the
  name of the object, for example: `'Hello'.length`.
- Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which
  perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or
  instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example:
  `'hello'.toUpperCase()`.
- We can access properties and methods by using the `.`, dot operator.
- Built-in objects, including `Math`, are collections of methods and
  properties that JavaScript provides.

# Variables

## Variables

In programming, a *variable* is a container for a value. You can think
of variables as little containers for information that live in a
computer’s memory. Information stored in variables, such as a username,
account number, or even personalized greeting can then be found in
memory.

Variables also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name,
so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and
ourselves.

In short, variables label and store data in memory. There are only a few
things you can do with variables:

1.  Create a variable with a descriptive name.
2.  Store or update information stored in a variable.
3.  Reference or “get” information stored in a variable.

It is important to distinguish that variables are not values; they
contain values and represent them with a name. Observe the diagram with
the colored boxes. Each box represents variables; the values are
represented by the content, and the name is represented with the label.

In this lesson, we will cover how to use the `var`, `let`, and `const`
keywords to create variables.



When you’re ready to start, go to the next exercise!

## Create a Variable: var

There were a lot of changes introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript
in 2015. One of the biggest changes was two new keywords, `let` and
`const`, to create, or *declare*, variables. Prior to the ES6,
programmers could only use the `var` keyword to declare variables.

``` js
var myName = 'Arya';
console.log(myName);
// Output: Arya
```

Let’s consider the example above:

1.  `var`, short for variable, is a JavaScript *keyword* that creates,
    or *declares*, a new variable.
2.  `myName` is the variable’s name. Capitalizing in this way is a
    standard convention in JavaScript called *camel casing*. In camel
    casing you group words into one, the first word is lowercase, then
    every word that follows will have its first letter uppercased. (e.g.
    camelCaseEverything).
3.  `=` is the *assignment operator*. It assigns the value (`'Arya'`) to
    the variable (`myName`).
4.  `'Arya'` is the *value* assigned (`=`) to the variable `myName`. You
    can also say that the `myName` variable is *initialized* with a
    value of `'Arya'`.
5.  After the variable is declared, the string value `'Arya'` is printed
    to the console by referencing the variable name:
    `console.log(myName)`.

There are a few general rules for naming variables:

- Variable names cannot start with numbers.
- Variable names are case sensitive, so `myName` and `myname` would be
  different variables. It is bad practice to create two variables that
  have the same name using different cases.
- Variable names cannot be the same as *keywords*. For a comprehensive
  list of keywords check out <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords"
  class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDN’s keyword documentation</a>.

In the next exercises, we will learn why ES6’s `let` and `const` are the
preferred variable keywords by many programmers. Because there is still
a ton of code written prior to ES6, it’s helpful to be familiar with the
pre-ES6 `var` keyword.

If you want to learn more about `var` and the quirks associated with it,
check out the <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDN var documentation</a>.



**1.**

Declare a variable named `favoriteFood` using the `var` keyword and
assign to it the string `'pizza'`.

**2.**

Declare a variable named `numOfSlices` using the `var` keyword and
assign to it the number `8`.

**3.**

Under the `numOfSlices` variable, use `console.log()` to print the value
saved to `favoriteFood`.

On the following line, use `console.log()` to print the value saved to
`numOfSlices`.



``` javascript
var favoriteFood = 'pizza';
var numOfSlices = 8;
console.log(favoriteFood);
console.log(numOfSlices);
```

    ## pizza
    ## 8

## Create a Variable: let

As mentioned in the previous exercise, the `let` keyword was introduced
in ES6. The `let` keyword signals that the variable can be reassigned a
different value. Take a look at the example:

``` js
let meal = 'Enchiladas';
console.log(meal); // Output: Enchiladas
meal = 'Burrito';
console.log(meal); // Output: Burrito
```

Another concept that we should be aware of when using `let` (and even
`var`) is that we can declare a variable without assigning the variable
a value. In such a case, the variable will be automatically initialized
with a value of `undefined`:

``` js
let price;
console.log(price); // Output: undefined
price = 350;
console.log(price); // Output: 350
```

Notice in the example above:

- If we don’t assign a value to a variable declared using the `let`
  keyword, it automatically has a value of `undefined`.
- We can reassign the value of the variable.



**1.**

Create a `let` variable called `changeMe` and set it equal to the
boolean `true`.

**2.**

On the line after `changeMe` is declared, set the value of `changeMe` to
be the boolean `false`.

To check if `changeMe` was reassigned, log the value saved to `changeMe`
to the console.



``` javascript
let changeMe = true;

changeMe = false;

console.log(changeMe);
```

    ## false

## Create a Variable: const

The `const` keyword was also introduced in ES6, and is short for the
word constant. Just like with `var` and `let` you can store any value in
a `const` variable. The way you declare a `const` variable and assign a
value to it follows the same structure as `let` and `var`. Take a look
at the following example:

``` js
const myName = 'Gilberto';
console.log(myName); // Output: Gilberto
```

However, a `const` variable cannot be reassigned because it is
*constant*. If you try to reassign a `const` variable, you’ll get a
`TypeError`.

Constant variables *must* be assigned a value when declared. If you try
to declare a `const` variable without a value, you’ll get a
`SyntaxError`.

If you’re trying to decide between which keyword to use, `let` or
`const`, think about whether you’ll need to reassign the variable later
on. If you do need to reassign the variable use `let`, otherwise, use
`const`.



**1.**

Create a constant variable named `entree` and set it to equal to the
string `'Enchiladas'`.

**2.**

Just to check that you’ve saved the value of `'Enchiladas'` to `entree`,
log the value of `entree` to the console.

**3.**

Great, let’s see what happens if you try to reassign a constant
variable.

Paste the following code to the bottom of your program.

``` js
entree = 'Tacos'
```

This code throws the following error when you run your code:

``` js
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

After you clear this checkpoint, if you want to see about another quirk
of `const` in action open the hint!



``` javascript
const entree = 'Enchiladas';

console.log(entree);

entree = 'Tacos'
```

``` js
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

## Mathematical Assignment Operators

Let’s consider how we can use variables and math operators to calculate
new values and assign them to a variable. Check out the example below:

``` js
let w = 4;
w = w + 1;
 
console.log(w); // Output: 5
```

In the example above, we created the variable `w` with the number `4`
assigned to it. The following line, `w = w + 1`, increases the value of
`w` from `4` to `5`.

Another way we could have reassigned `w` after performing some
mathematical operation on it is to use built-in *mathematical assignment
operators*. We could re-write the code above to be:

``` js
let w = 4;
w += 1;
 
console.log(w); // Output: 5
```

In the second example, we used the `+=` assignment operator to reassign
`w`. We’re performing the mathematical operation of the first operator
`+` using the number to the right, then reassigning `w` to the computed
value.

We also have access to other mathematical assignment operators: `-=`,
`*=`, and `/=` which work in a similar fashion.

``` js
let x = 20;
x -= 5; // Can be written as x = x - 5
console.log(x); // Output: 15
 
let y = 50;
y *= 2; // Can be written as y = y * 2
console.log(y); // Output: 100
 
let z = 8;
z /= 2; // Can be written as z = z / 2
console.log(z); // Output: 4
```

Let’s practice using these mathematical assignment operators!



**1.**

Use the `+=` mathematical assignment operator to increase the value
stored in `levelUp` by `5`.

**2.**

Use the `-=` mathematical assignment operator to decrease the value
stored in `powerLevel` by `100`.

**3.**

Use the `*=` mathematical assignment operator to multiply the value
stored in `multiplyMe` by `11`.

**4.**

Use the `/=` mathematical assignment operator to divide the value stored
in `quarterMe` by `4`.



``` javascript
let levelUp = 10;
let powerLevel = 9001;
let multiplyMe = 32;
let quarterMe = 1152;

// Use the mathematical assignments in the space below:
levelUp += 5;
powerLevel -= 100;
multiplyMe *= 11;
quarterMe /= 4;


// These console.log() statements below will help you check the values of the variables.
// You do not need to edit these statements. 
console.log('The value of levelUp:', levelUp); 
console.log('The value of powerLevel:', powerLevel); 
console.log('The value of multiplyMe:', multiplyMe); 
console.log('The value of quarterMe:', quarterMe);
```

    ## The value of levelUp: 15
    ## The value of powerLevel: 8901
    ## The value of multiplyMe: 352
    ## The value of quarterMe: 288

## The Increment and Decrement Operator

Other mathematical assignment operators include the *increment operator*
(`++`) and *decrement operator* (`--`).

The increment operator will increase the value of the variable by 1. The
decrement operator will decrease the value of the variable by 1. For
example:

``` js
let a = 10;
a++;
console.log(a); // Output: 11
```

``` js
let b = 20;
b--;
console.log(b); // Output: 19
```

Just like the previous mathematical assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`,
`*=`, `/=`), the variable’s value is updated *and* assigned as the new
value of that variable.



**1.**

Using the increment operator, increase the value of `gainedDollar`.

**2.**

Using the decrement operator, decrease the value of `lostDollar`.



``` javascript
let gainedDollar = 3;
let lostDollar = 50;

gainedDollar++;
lostDollar--;
```

## String Concatenation with Variables

In previous exercises, we assigned strings to variables. Now, let’s go
over how to connect, or concatenate, strings in variables.

The `+` operator can be used to combine two string values even if those
values are being stored in variables:

``` js
let myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.'); 
// Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'
```

In the example above, we assigned the value `'armadillo'` to the `myPet`
variable. On the second line, the `+` operator is used to combine three
strings: `'I own a pet'`, the value saved to `myPet`, and `'.'`. We log
the result of this concatenation to the console as:

    I own a pet armadillo.



**1.**

Create a variable named `favoriteAnimal` and set it equal to your
favorite animal.

**2.**

Use `console.log()` to print `'My favorite animal: ANIMAL'` to the
console. Use string concatenation so that `ANIMAL` is replaced with the
value in your `favoriteAnimal` variable.



``` javascript
let favoriteAnimal = "giraffe";

console.log("My favorite animal: " + favoriteAnimal);
```

    ## My favorite animal: giraffe

## String Interpolation

In the ES6 version of JavaScript, we can insert, or *interpolate*,
variables into strings using *template literals*. Check out the
following example where a template literal is used to log strings
together:

``` js
const myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log(`I own a pet ${myPet}.`);
// Output: I own a pet armadillo.
```

Notice that:

- a template literal is wrapped by backticks `` ` `` (this key is
  usually located on the top of your keyboard, left of the
  <span class="kbd">1</span> key).
- Inside the template literal, you’ll see a placeholder, `${myPet}`. The
  value of `myPet` is inserted into the template literal.
- When we interpolate `` `I own a pet ${myPet}.` ``, the output we print
  is the string: `'I own a pet armadillo.'`

One of the biggest benefits to using template literals is the
readability of the code. Using template literals, you can more easily
tell what the new string will be. You also don’t have to worry about
escaping double quotes or single quotes.



**1.**

Create a variable called `myName` and assign it your name.

**2.**

Create a variable called `myCity` and assign it your favorite city’s
name.

**3.**

Use a single template literal to interpolate your variables into the
sentence below. Use `console.log()` to print your sentence to the
console in the following format:

    My name is NAME. My favorite city is CITY.

Replace `NAME` and `CITY` in the string above by interpolating the
values saved to `myName` and `myCity`.



``` javascript
let myName = 'Natalia';
let myCity = 'Mexico City';

console.log(`My name is ${myName}. My favorite city is ${myCity}.`)
```

    ## My name is Natalia. My favorite city is Mexico City.

## typeof operator

While writing code, it can be useful to keep track of the data types of
the variables in your program. If you need to check the data type of a
variable’s value, you can use the `typeof` operator.

The `typeof` operator checks the value to its right and *returns*, or
passes back, a string of the data type.

``` js
const unknown1 = 'foo';
console.log(typeof unknown1); // Output: string
 
const unknown2 = 10;
console.log(typeof unknown2); // Output: number
 
const unknown3 = true; 
console.log(typeof unknown3); // Output: boolean
```

Let’s break down the first example. Since the value `unknown1` is
`'foo'`, a string, `typeof unknown1` will return `'string'`.



**1.**

Use `console.log()` to print the `typeof newVariable`.

**2.**

Great, now let’s check what happens if we reassign the variable. Below
the `console.log()` statement, reassign `newVariable` to `1`.

**3.**

Since you assigned this new value to `newVariable`, it has a new type!
On the line below your reassignment, use `console.log()` to print
`typeof newVariable` again.



``` javascript
let newVariable = 'Playing around with typeof.';

console.log(typeof newVariable);

newVariable = 1;

console.log(typeof newVariable);
```

    ## string
    ## number

## Review Variables

Nice work! This lesson introduced you to variables, a powerful concept
you will use in all your future programming endeavors.

Let’s review what we learned:

- Variables hold reusable data in a program and associate it with a
  name.
- Variables are stored in memory.
- The `var` keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS.
- `let` is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be
  reassigned, and `const` is the preferred way to declare a variable
  with a constant value.
- Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type
  `undefined`.
- Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new
  value and assign it to the same variable.
- The `+` operator is used to concatenate strings including string
  values held in variables.
- In ES6, template literals use backticks `` ` `` and `${}` to
  interpolate values into a string.
- The `typeof` keyword returns the data type (as a string) of a value.



To learn more about variables take on these challenges!

- Create variables and manipulate the values.
- Check what happens when you try concatenating strings using variables
  of different data types.
- Interpolate multiple variables into a string.
- See what happens when you use `console.log()` on variables declared by
  different keywords (`const`, `let`, `var`) before they’re defined. For
  example:

``` js
console.log(test1);
 
const test1 = 'figuring out quirks';
```

- Find the data type of a variable’s value using the `typeof` keyword on
  a variable.
- Use `typeof` to find the data type of the resulting value when you
  concatenate variables containing two different data types.

# Kelvin Weather

Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has
mastered weather prediction.

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website.
However there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelvin</a>.

With our knowledge of JavaScript, let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius, then
to Fahrenheit.

class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit thermometers" />

For example, 283 K converts to 10 °C which converts to 50 °F.

Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off

1\.

The forecast today is `293` Kelvin. To start, create a variable named
`kelvin`, and set it equal to `293`.

The value saved to `kelvin` will stay constant. Choose the variable type
with this in mind.

2\.

Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

3\.

Celsius is similar to Kelvin — the only difference is that Celsius is
`273` degrees less than Kelvin.

Let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius by subtracting `273` from the `kelvin`
variable. Store the result in another variable, named `celsius`.

4\.

Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

5\.

Use this equation to calculate Fahrenheit, then store the answer in a
variable named `fahrenheit`.

*Fahrenheit = Celsius \* (9/5) + 32*

In the next step we will round the number saved to `fahrenheit`. Choose
the variable type that allows you to change its value.

6\.

Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

7\.

When you convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, you often get a decimal
number.

Use the `.floor()` method from the built-in Math object to round down
the Fahrenheit temperature. Save the result to the `fahrenheit`
variable.

8\.

Write a comment above that explains this line of code.

9\.

Use `console.log` and string interpolation to log the temperature in
`fahrenheit` to the console as follows:

``` js
The temperature is TEMPERATURE degrees Fahrenheit.
```

Use string interpolation to replace `TEMPERATURE` with the value saved
to `fahrenheit`.

10\.

Run your program to see your results!

If you want to check your work, open the hint.

11\.

By using variables, your program should work for any Kelvin temperature
— just change the value of `kelvin` and run the program again.

What’s `0` Kelvin in Fahrenheit?

12\.

Great work! Kelvin can now publish his forecasts in Celsius and
Fahrenheit.

If you’d like extra practice, try this:

- Convert `celsius` to the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_scale"
  class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newton</a> scale using the equation
  below

*Newton = Celsius \* (33/100)*

- Round down the Newton temperature using the `.floor()` method
- Use `console.log` and string interpolation to log the temperature in
  `newton` to the console

## [Solution](kelvin-weather-javascript)

``` javascript
//Temperature in Kelvin
const kelvin = 293;

//Temperature in Celsius (conversion from Kelvin)
let celsius = kelvin - 273;

//Temperature in Farenheit (convert from Celsius)
//used Math.floor() method to round number to whole number
let farenheit = Math.floor(celsius * (9 / 5) + 32);

//Temperature in Newton Scale (convert from Celsius)
//Use Math.floor() method to round number to whole number
let newton = Math.floor(celsius * (33 / 100));

//Answers
console.log(`The temperature is ${kelvin} degrees Kelvin.`);
console.log(`The temperature is ${celsius} degrees Celsius.`);
console.log(`The temperature is ${farenheit} degrees Fahrenheit.`);
console.log(`The temperature is ${newton} degrees Newton.`);
```

    ## The temperature is 293 degrees Kelvin.
    ## The temperature is 20 degrees Celsius.
    ## The temperature is 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
    ## The temperature is 6 degrees Newton.

# Dog Years

Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age
can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to
a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly
for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s
life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

- The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
- Each year following equates to 4 dog years.

Before you start doing the math in your head, let a computer take care
of it! With your knowledge of math operators and variables, use
JavaScript to convert your human age into dog years.

Let’s use a string method next.

Write your name as a string, call its built-in method `.toLowerCase()`,
and store the result in a variable called `myName`.

The `toLowerCase` method returns a string with all lowercase letters.

Write a comment that explains this line of code.

9\.

Write a `console.log` statement that displays your name and age in dog
years. Use string interpolation to display the value in the following
sentence:

``` js
My name is NAME. I am HUMAN AGE years old in human years which is DOG AGE years old in dog years.
```

Replace `NAME` with `myName`, `HUMAN AGE` with `myAge`, and `DOG AGE`
with `myAgeInDogYears` in the sentence above.

Write a comment that explains this line of code.

10\.

Great work! You can convert any human age to dog years. Try changing
`myAge` and see what happens.

If you’d like extra practice, try writing this project without the `*=`
operator.

## [Solution](dog-years-javascript)

``` javascript
//Setting my age for the human age
const myAge = 20;

//Creating a variable for the early years
let earlyYears = 2;

earlyYears = earlyYears * 10.5;
console.log(`Dog years for the first 2 years: ${earlyYears}.`);

//Setting a number since we accounted for the early years
let laterYears = myAge - 2;

//Calculating the later years in dog years
laterYears *= 4;
console.log(`Dog years for the years after that: ${laterYears}.`);

//Creating a variable to hold my human years in dog years
let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;

//Creating a variable for my name
const myName = "datttrian".toLowerCase();

//Creating the console result in a readable way
console.log(
  `My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`
);
```

    ## Dog years for the first 2 years: 21.
    ## Dog years for the years after that: 72.
    ## My name is datttrian. I am 20 years old in human years which is 93 years old in dog years.

# Conditional Statements

## What are Conditional Statements?

In life, we make decisions based on circumstances. Think of an everyday
decision as mundane as falling asleep — if we are tired, we go to bed,
otherwise, we wake up and start our day.

These if-else decisions can be modeled in code by creating conditional
statements. A <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/conditionals?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">conditional statement</a> checks a specific condition(s)
and performs a task based on the condition(s).

In this lesson, we will explore how programs make decisions by
evaluating conditions and introduce logic into our code!

We’ll be covering the following concepts:

- `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements
- comparison operators
- logical operators
- truthy vs falsy values
- ternary operators
- `switch` statement

So *if* you’re ready to learn these concepts go to the next lesson—
*else*, read over the concepts, observe the diagram, and prepare
yourself for this lesson!



Check out the diagram to see how conditionals allow us to create
decision-making technology.



<img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-conditionals/control_flow_diagram_v5.svg" alt="If sleepy -> sleep in. Else -> start your day." class="gamut-1h2re45-imageStyles-imageStyles e1xtjyf0">

## If Statement

We often perform a task based on a condition. For example, if the
weather is nice today, then we will go outside. If the alarm clock
rings, then we’ll shut it off. If we’re tired, then we’ll go to sleep.

In programming, we can also perform a task based on a condition using an
`if` statement:

``` js
if (true) {
  console.log('This message will print!'); 
}
// Prints: This message will print!
```

Notice in the example above, we have an `if` statement. The `if`
statement is composed of:

- The `if` keyword followed by a set of parentheses `()` which is
  followed by a *code block*, or *block statement*, indicated by a set
  of curly braces `{}`.
- Inside the parentheses `()`, a condition is provided that evaluates to
  `true` or `false`.
- If the condition evaluates to `true`, the code inside the curly braces
  `{}` runs, or *executes*.
- If the condition evaluates to `false`, the block won’t execute.

Let’s make an `if` statement.



**1.**

Using the `let` keyword, declare a variable named `sale`. Assign the
value `true` to it.

**2.**

Now create an `if` statement. Provide the `if` statement a condition of
`sale`.

Inside the code block of the `if` statement, `console.log()` the string
`'Time to buy!'`.

**3.**

Notice that the code inside the `if` statement ran, since
`'Time to buy!'` was logged to the console.

Below the `sale` variable declaration, but before the `if` statement,
reassign `sale` to `false`. Run your code and observe what happens,
we’ll be changing this behavior in the next exercise.



``` javascript
let sale = true;

sale = false;

if (sale) {
  console.log('Time to buy!');
}
```

## If…Else Statements

In the previous exercise, we used an `if` statement that checked a
condition to decide whether or not to run a block of code. In many
cases, we’ll have code we want to run if our condition evaluates to
`false`.

If we wanted to add some default behavior to the `if` statement, we can
add an <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/conditionals?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank"><code class="code__2rdF32qjRVp7mMVBHuPwDS">else</code>
statement</a> to run a block of code when the condition evaluates to
`false`. Take a look at the inclusion of an `else` statement:

``` js
if (false) {
  console.log('The code in this block will not run.');
} else {
  console.log('But the code in this block will!');
}
 
// Prints: But the code in this block will!
```

An `else` statement must be paired with an `if` statement, and together
they are referred to as an `if...else` statement.

In the example above, the `else` statement:

- Uses the `else` keyword following the code block of an `if` statement.
- Has a code block that is wrapped by a set of curly braces `{}`.
- The code inside the `else` statement code block will execute when the
  `if` statement’s condition evaluates to `false`.

`if...else` statements allow us to automate solutions to yes-or-no
questions, also known as *binary decisions*.



**1.**

Add an `else` statement to the existing `if` statement. Inside the code
block of the `else` statement, `console.log()` the string
`'Time to wait for a sale.'`



``` javascript
let sale = true;

sale = false;

if (sale) {
  console.log('Time to buy!');
} else {
  console.log('Time to wait for a sale.')
}
```

    ## Time to wait for a sale.

## Comparison Operators

When writing conditional statements, sometimes we need to use different
types of operators to compare values. These operators are called
*comparison operators*.

Here is a list of some handy comparison operators and their syntax:

- Less than: `<`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Is equal to: `===`
- Is not equal to: `!==`

Comparison operators compare the value on the left with the value on the
right. For instance:

``` js
10 < 12 // Evaluates to true
```

It can be helpful to think of comparison statements as questions. When
the answer is “yes”, the statement evaluates to `true`, and when the
answer is “no”, the statement evaluates to `false`. The code above would
be asking: is 10 less than 12? Yes! So `10 < 12` evaluates to `true`.

We can also use comparison operators on different data types like
strings:

``` js
'apples' === 'oranges' // false
```

In the example above, we’re using the *identity operator* (`===`) to
check if the string `'apples'` is the same as the string `'oranges'`.
Since the two strings are not the same, the comparison statement
evaluates to `false`.

All comparison statements evaluate to either `true` or `false` and are
made up of:

- Two values that will be compared.
- An operator that separates the values and compares them accordingly
  (`>`, `<`, `<=`,`>=`,`===`,`!==`).

Let’s practice using these comparison operators!



**1.**

Using `let`, create a variable named `hungerLevel` and set it equal to
`7`.

**2.**

Write an `if...else` statement using a comparison operator. The
condition should check if `hungerLevel` is greater than `7`. If so, the
conditional statement should log, `'Time to eat!'`. Otherwise, it should
log `'We can eat later!'`.

After you press run, play around with the condition by tweaking the
comparison of `hungerLevel` by using different operators such as
`<=`,`>=`,`>`, and `<`.



``` javascript
let hungerLevel = 7;

if (hungerLevel > 7) {
  console.log('Time to eat!');
} else {
  console.log('We can eat later!');
};
```

    ## We can eat later!

## Logical Operators

Working with conditionals means that we will be using booleans, `true`
or `false` values. In JavaScript, there are operators that work with
boolean values known as *logical operators*. We can use logical
operators to add more sophisticated logic to our conditionals. There are
three logical operators:

- the *and* operator (`&&`)
- the *or* operator (`||`)
- the *not* operator, otherwise known as the *bang* operator (`!`)

When we use the `&&` operator, we are checking that two things are
`true`:

``` js
if (stopLight === 'green' && pedestrians === 0) {
  console.log('Go!');
} else {
  console.log('Stop');
}
```

When using the `&&` operator, both conditions *must* evaluate to `true`
for the entire condition to evaluate to `true` and execute. Otherwise,
if either condition is `false`, the `&&` condition will evaluate to
`false` and the `else` block will execute.

If we only care about either condition being `true`, we can use the `||`
operator:

``` js
if (day === 'Saturday' || day === 'Sunday') {
  console.log('Enjoy the weekend!');
} else {
  console.log('Do some work.');
}
```

When using the `||` operator, only one of the conditions must evaluate
to `true` for the overall statement to evaluate to `true`. In the code
example above, if either `day === 'Saturday'` or `day === 'Sunday'`
evaluates to `true` the `if`’s condition will evaluate to `true` and its
code block will execute. If the first condition in an `||` statement
evaluates to `true`, the second condition won’t even be checked. Only if
`day === 'Saturday'` evaluates to `false` will `day === 'Sunday'` be
evaluated. The code in the `else` statement above will execute only if
both comparisons evaluate to `false`.

The `!` *not operator* reverses, or *negates*, the value of a boolean:

``` js
let excited = true;
console.log(!excited); // Prints false
 
let sleepy = false;
console.log(!sleepy); // Prints true
```

Essentially, the `!` operator will either take a `true` value and pass
back `false`, or it will take a `false` value and pass back `true`.

Logical operators are often used in conditional statements to add
another layer of logic to our code.



**1.**

In **main.js** there are two variables `mood` and `tirednessLevel`.

Let’s create an `if...else` statement that checks if `mood` is
`'sleepy'` and `tirednessLevel` is greater than `8`.

If both conditions evaluate to `true`, then `console.log()` the string
`'time to sleep'`. Otherwise, we should `console.log()`
`'not bed time yet'`.

After you press “Run”, play around with the `||` operator and the `!`
operator! What happens if you negate the value of the entire statement
with `!` and switch to `||` instead of `&&`?



``` javascript
let mood = 'sleepy';
let tirednessLevel = 6;

if (mood === 'sleepy' && tirednessLevel > 8) {
  console.log('time to sleep');
} else {
  console.log('not bed time yet');
}
```

    ## not bed time yet

## Truthy and Falsy

Let’s consider how non-boolean data types, like strings or numbers, are
evaluated when checked inside a condition.

Sometimes, you’ll want to check if a variable exists and you won’t
necessarily want it to equal a specific value — you’ll only check to see
if the variable has been assigned a value.

Here’s an example:

``` js
let myVariable = 'I Exist!';
 
if (myVariable) {
   console.log(myVariable)
} else {
   console.log('The variable does not exist.')
}
```

The code block in the `if` statement will run because `myVariable` has a
*truthy* value; even though the value of `myVariable` is not explicitly
the value `true`, when used in a boolean or conditional context, it
evaluates to `true` because it has been assigned a non-falsy value.

So which values are *falsy*— or evaluate to `false` when checked as a
condition? The list of falsy values includes:

- `0`
- Empty strings like `""` or `''`
- `null` which represent when there is no value at all
- `undefined` which represent when a declared variable lacks a value
- `NaN`, or Not a Number

Here’s an example with numbers:

``` js
let numberOfApples = 0;
 
if (numberOfApples){
   console.log('Let us eat apples!');
} else {
   console.log('No apples left!');
}
 
// Prints 'No apples left!'
```

The condition evaluates to `false` because the value of the
`numberOfApples` is `0`. Since `0` is a falsy value, the code block in
the `else` statement will run.



**1.**

Change the value of `wordCount` so that it is truthy. This value should
still be a number.

After you make this change and run your code,
`'Great! You've started your work!'` should log to the console.

**2.**

Change the value of `favoritePhrase` so that it is still a string but
falsy.

After you make this change and run your code,
`'This string is definitely empty.'` should log to the console.



``` javascript
let wordCount = 1;

if (wordCount) {
  console.log("Great! You've started your work!");
} else {
  console.log('Better get to work!');
}


let favoritePhrase = '';

if (favoritePhrase) {
  console.log("This string doesn't seem to be empty.");
} else {
  console.log('This string is definitely empty.');
}
```

    ## Great! You've started your work!
    ## This string is definitely empty.

## Truthy and Falsy Assignment

Truthy and falsy evaluations open a world of short-hand possibilities!

Say you have a website and want to take a user’s username to make a
personalized greeting. Sometimes, the user does not have an account,
making the `username` variable falsy. The code below checks if
`username` is defined and assigns a default string if it is not:

``` js
let username = '';
let defaultName;
 
if (username) {
  defaultName = username;
} else {
  defaultName = 'Stranger';
}
 
console.log(defaultName); // Prints: Stranger
```

If you combine your knowledge of logical operators you can use a
short-hand for the code above. In a boolean condition, JavaScript
assigns the truthy value to a variable if you use the `||` operator in
your assignment:

``` js
let username = '';
let defaultName = username || 'Stranger';
 
console.log(defaultName); // Prints: Stranger
```

Because `||` or statements check the left-hand condition first, the
variable `defaultName` will be assigned the actual value of `username`
if it is truthy, and it will be assigned the value of `'Stranger'` if
`username` is falsy. This concept is also referred to as *short-circuit
evaluation*.



**1.**

Let’s use short-circuit evaluation to assign a value to
`writingUtensil`. Do not edit `tool` yet, we’ll return to `tool` in the
next step.

Assign to `writingUtensil` the value of `tool` and if `tool` is falsy,
assign a default value of `'pen'`.

**2.**

Notice that text `'The pen is mightier than the sword'` logged to the
console. Which means the value of `writingUtensil` is `'pen'`.

What if we reassign the value of `tool` to `'marker'`. Let’s see what
happens to the value of `writingUtensil`.



``` javascript
let tool = '';

tool = 'marker';

// Use short circuit evaluation to assign writingUtensil variable below:
let writingUtensil = tool || 'pen';

console.log(`The ${writingUtensil} is mightier than the sword.`);
```

    ## The marker is mightier than the sword.

## Ternary Operator

In the spirit of using short-hand syntax, we can use a *ternary
operator* to simplify an `if...else` statement.

Take a look at the `if...else` statement example:

``` js
let isNightTime = true;
 
if (isNightTime) {
  console.log('Turn on the lights!');
} else {
  console.log('Turn off the lights!');
}
```

We can use a *ternary operator* to perform the same functionality:

``` js
isNightTime ? console.log('Turn on the lights!') : console.log('Turn off the lights!');
```

In the example above:

- The condition, `isNightTime`, is provided before the `?`.
- Two expressions follow the `?` and are separated by a colon `:`.
- If the condition evaluates to `true`, the first expression executes.
- If the condition evaluates to `false`, the second expression executes.

Like `if...else` statements, ternary operators can be used for
conditions which evaluate to `true` or `false`.



**1.**

Refactor, or edit, the first `if...else` block to use a ternary
operator.

**2.**

Refactor the second `if...else` block to use a ternary operator.

**3.**

Refactor the third `if...else` block to use a ternary operator.



``` javascript
let isLocked = false;

isLocked ? console.log('You will need a key to open the door.') : console.log('You will not need a key to open the door.');

let isCorrect = true;

isCorrect ? console.log('Correct!') : console.log('Incorrect!');

let favoritePhrase = 'Love That!';

favoritePhrase === 'Love That!' ? console.log('I love that!') : console.log("I don't love that!");
```

    ## You will not need a key to open the door.
    ## Correct!
    ## I love that!

## Else If Statements

We can add more conditions to our `if...else` with an <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/conditionals?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank"><code
class="code__2rdF32qjRVp7mMVBHuPwDS">else if</code> statement</a>. The
`else if` statement allows for more than two possible outcomes. You can
add as many `else if` statements as you’d like, to make more complex
conditionals!

The `else if` statement always comes after the `if` statement and before
the `else` statement. The `else if` statement also takes a condition.
Let’s take a look at the syntax:

``` js
let stopLight = 'yellow';
 
if (stopLight === 'red') {
  console.log('Stop!');
} else if (stopLight === 'yellow') {
  console.log('Slow down.');
} else if (stopLight === 'green') {
  console.log('Go!');
} else {
  console.log('Caution, unknown!');
}
```

The `else if` statements allow you to have multiple possible outcomes.
`if`/`else if`/`else` statements are read from top to bottom, so the
first condition that evaluates to `true` from the top to bottom is the
block that gets executed.

In the example above, since `stopLight === 'red'` evaluates to `false`
and `stopLight === 'yellow'` evaluates to `true`, the code inside the
first `else if` statement is executed. The rest of the conditions are
not evaluated. If none of the conditions evaluated to `true`, then the
code in the `else` statement would have executed.



**1.**

Let’s create a program that keeps track of the way the environment
changes with the seasons. Write a conditional statement to make this
happen!

In **main.js** there is already an `if...else` statement in place. Let’s
add an `else if` statement that checks if `season` is equal to
`'winter'`.

Inside the code block of the `else if` statement, add a `console.log()`
that prints the string `'It\'s winter! Everything is covered in snow.'`.

Make sure that the structure uses `if`, `else if`, and `else`.

**2.**

Add another `else if` statement that checks if `season` is equal to
`'fall'`.

Inside the code block of the `else if` statement you just created, add a
`console.log()` that prints the string
`'It\'s fall! Leaves are falling!'`.

**3.**

Add a final `else if` statement that checks if `season` is equal to
`'summer'`.

Inside the code block of the `else if` statement you just created, add a
`console.log()` that prints the string
`'It\'s sunny and warm because it\'s summer!'`.



``` javascript
let season = 'summer';

if (season === 'spring') {
  console.log('It\'s spring! The trees are budding!');
} else if(season === 'winter') {
  console.log('It\'s winter! Everything is covered in snow.');
} else if(season === 'fall') {
  console.log('It\'s fall! Leaves are falling!');
} else if(season === 'summer') {
  console.log('It\'s sunny and warm because it\'s summer!');
} else {
  console.log('Invalid season.');
}
```

    ## It's sunny and warm because it's summer!

## The switch keyword

`else if` statements are a great tool if we need to check multiple
conditions. In programming, we often find ourselves needing to check
multiple values and handling each of them differently. For example:

``` js
let groceryItem = 'papaya';
 
if (groceryItem === 'tomato') {
  console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');
} else if (groceryItem === 'papaya'){
  console.log('Papayas are $1.29');
} else {
  console.log('Invalid item');
}
```

In the code above, we have a series of conditions checking for a value
that matches a `groceryItem` variable. Our code works fine, but imagine
if we needed to check 100 different values! Having to write that many
`else if` statements sounds like a pain!

A <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/switch?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank"><code class="code__2rdF32qjRVp7mMVBHuPwDS">switch</code>
statement</a> provides an alternative syntax that is easier to read and
write. A `switch` statement looks like this:

``` js
let groceryItem = 'papaya';
 
switch (groceryItem) {
  case 'tomato':
    console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');
    break;
  case 'lime':
    console.log('Limes are $1.49');
    break;
  case 'papaya':
    console.log('Papayas are $1.29');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Invalid item');
    break;
}
 
// Prints 'Papayas are $1.29'
```

- The `switch` keyword initiates the statement and is followed by
  `( ... )`, which contains the value that each `case` will compare. In
  the example, the value or expression of the `switch` statement is
  `groceryItem`.
- Inside the block, `{ ... }`, there are multiple `case`s. The `case`
  keyword checks if the expression matches the specified value that
  comes after it. The value following the first `case` is `'tomato'`. If
  the value of `groceryItem` equalled `'tomato'`, that `case`’s
  `console.log()` would run.
- The value of `groceryItem` is `'papaya'`, so the third `case` runs—
  `Papayas are $1.29` is logged to the console.
- The `break` keyword tells the computer to exit the block and not
  execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block.
  Note: Without `break` keywords, the first matching case will run, but
  so will every subsequent case regardless of whether or not it
  matches—including the default. This behavior is different from
  `if`/`else` conditional statements that execute only one block of
  code.
- At the end of each `switch` statement, there is a `default` statement.
  If none of the `case`s are true, then the code in the `default`
  statement will run.



**1.**

Let’s write a `switch` statement to decide what medal to award an
athlete.

`athleteFinalPosition` is already defined at the top of **main.js**. So
start by writing a `switch` statement with `athleteFinalPosition` as its
expression.

**2.**

Inside the `switch` statement, add three `case`s:

- The first `case` checks for the value `'first place'`
  - If the expression’s value matches the value of the `case` then
    `console.log()` the string `'You get the gold medal!'`
- The second `case` checks for the value `'second place'`
  - If the expression’s value matches the value of the `case` then
    `console.log()` the string `'You get the silver medal!'`
- The third `case` checks for the value `'third place'`
  - If the expression’s value matches the value of the `case` then
    `console.log()` the string `'You get the bronze medal!'`

Remember to add a `break` after each `console.log()`.

**3.**

Now, add a `default` statement at the end of the `switch` that uses
`console.log()` to print `'No medal awarded.'`.

If `athleteFinalPosition` does not equal any value of our `case`s, then
the string `'No medal awarded.'` is logged to the console.

Remember to add the `break` keyword at the end of the `default` case.



``` javascript
let athleteFinalPosition = 'first place';

switch(athleteFinalPosition){
  case 'first place':
    console.log('You get the gold medal!');
    break;
  case 'second place':
    console.log('You get the silver medal!');
    break;
  case 'third place':
    console.log('You get the bronze medal!');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('No medal awarded.');
    break;
}
```

    ## You get the gold medal!

## Review

Way to go! Here are some of the major concepts for conditionals:

- An `if` statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that
  condition evaluates to `true`.
- `if...else` statements make binary decisions and execute different
  code blocks based on a provided condition.
- We can add more conditions using `else if` statements.
- Comparison operators, including `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `===`, and `!==`
  can compare two values.
- The logical and operator, `&&`, or “and”, checks if both provided
  expressions are truthy.
- The logical operator `||`, or “or”, checks if either provided
  expression is truthy.
- The bang operator, `!`, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a
  value.
- The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise `if...else`
  statements.
- A `switch` statement can be used to simplify the process of writing
  multiple `else if` statements. The `break` keyword stops the remaining
  `case`s from being checked and executed in a `switch` statement.

If the user wants, they can enter their name in between the quotation
marks.

2\.

Below this variable, create a ternary expression that decides what to do
if the user enters a name or not. If the user enters a name — like
`'Jane'` — use string interpolation to log `Hello, Jane!` to the
console. Otherwise, simply log `Hello!`.

3\.

Create a variable named `userQuestion`. The value of the variable should
be a string that is the question the user wants to ask the Magic Eight
Ball.

4\.

Write a `console.log()` for the `userQuestion`, stating what was asked.
You can include the user’s name in the `console.log()` statement, if you
wish!

5\.

We need to generate a random number between 0 and 7.

Create another variable, and name it `randomNumber`. Set it equal to
this expression, which uses two methods (<a

Math library.

``` js
Math.floor(Math.random() * 8);
```

Check the hint to learn how it works!

6\.

Create one more variable named `eightBall`, and set it equal to an empty
string. We will save a value to this variable in the next steps,
depending on the value of `randomNumber`.

7\.

We need to create a control flow that takes in the `randomNumber` we
made in step 5, and then assigns `eightBall` to a reply that a Magic
Eight Ball would return. Think about utilizing `if`/`else` or `switch`
statements. Here are 8 Magic Eight Ball phrases that we’d like to save
to the variable `eightBall`:

- `'It is certain'`
- `'It is decidedly so'`
- `'Reply hazy try again'`
- `'Cannot predict now'`
- `'Do not count on it'`
- `'My sources say no'`
- `'Outlook not so good'`
- `'Signs point to yes'`

If the `randomNumber` is `0`, then save an answer to the `eightBall`
variable; if `randomNumber` is `1`, then save the next answer, and so
on. If you’re feeling creative, make your own responses!

8\.

Write a `console.log()` to print the Magic Eight Ball’s answer, the
value of the `eightBall` variable.

9\.

Run your program a few times to see random results appear in the
console!

If you want extra practice:

- If you started with a `switch` statement, convert it to
  `if`/`else if`/`else` statements.
- If you started with `if`/`else if`/`else` statements, convert them to
  a `switch` statement.

# Race Day

Codecademy’s annual race is just around the corner! This year, we have a
lot of participants. You have been hired to write a program that will
register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.

As a timeline, registration would look like this: <img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/projects/introduction-to-javascript/learn-javascript-control-flow/race-day/raceday-timeline.svg"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="registration-timeline" />

Here’s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18
years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can
register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start
time based on their age and registration.

Race number:

- Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
- All others receive a number below 1000.

Start time:

- Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
  - Early adults run at 9:30 am.
  - Late adults run at 11:00 am.
- Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).

But we didn’t plan for runners that are exactly 18! We’ll handle that by
the end of the project.

If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced
developer work through it, click “**Get Unstuck**“ to see a **project
walkthrough video**.



Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off

1\.

Race numbers are assigned randomly. We’ve provided the necessary code at
the top of the file.

Check off this task after reading that line.

You can read the hint if you want to learn how it works!

2\.

Create a variable that indicates whether a runner registered early or
not.

Set it equal to a Boolean value. You’ll change this later as you test
different runner conditions.

3\.

Create a variable for the runner’s age and set it equal to a number.

You’ll change this later as you test different runner conditions.

4\.

Create a control flow statement that checks whether the runner is an
adult AND registered early.

Add `1000` to their `raceNumber` if this is true.

5\.

Create a separate control flow statement below the first (starting with
`if` again). This statement will check age and registration time to
determine race time.

For runners over 18 who registered early, log a statement to the console
telling them that they will race at 9:30 am. Include their `raceNumber`.

6\.

“Late adults run at 11:00 am”

Since we already checked for early adults we can write a statement like
this: *else if runner is over 18 AND did not register early they will
race at 11:00am*

Write the corresponding `else if` statement.

Within that, log a string to the console telling them that they will
race at 11:00 am. Include their `raceNumber`.

7\.

“Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration)”

For people who are under 18, log a statement to the console telling them
that they will race at 12:30 pm. Include their `raceNumber`.

8\.

Enter different combinations of values for the two variables you created
and run your code several times. Verify that the correct statements are
printing to the console!

You can check your work using the examples provided in the hint.

9\.

Don’t forget about runners exactly 18 years old!

Add an `else` statement that logs a statement to the console telling the
runner to see the registration desk.

## [Solution](race-day)

``` javascript
let raceNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
let earlyReg = false;
let runnerAge = 20;

if (runnerAge > 18 && earlyReg === true) {
  raceNumber += 1000;
}

console.log(raceNumber);

if (runnerAge > 18 && earlyReg === true) {
  console.log(`Entrant number ${raceNumber} will race at 9:30 am.`);
} else if (runnerAge > 18 && earlyReg === false) {
  console.log(`Entrant number ${raceNumber} will race at 11:00 am.`);
} else {
  console.log("Please see the registration desk.");
}

if (runnerAge < 18) {
  console.log(`Entrant number ${raceNumber} will race at 12:30 pm.`);
}
```

    ## 444
    ## Entrant number 444 will race at 11:00 am.

# Functions

## What are Functions?

When first learning how to calculate the area of a rectangle, there’s a
sequence of steps to calculate the correct answer:

1.  Measure the width of the rectangle.
2.  Measure the height of the rectangle.
3.  Multiply the width and height of the rectangle.

With practice, you can calculate the area of the rectangle without being
instructed with these three steps every time.

We can calculate the area of one rectangle with the following code:

``` js
const width = 10;
const height = 6;
const area =  width * height;
console.log(area); // Output: 60
```

Imagine being asked to calculate the area of three different rectangles:

``` js
// Area of the first rectangle
const width1 = 10;
const height1 = 6;
const area1 =  width1 * height1;
 
// Area of the second rectangle
const width2 = 4;
const height2 = 9;
const area2 =  width2 * height2;
 
// Area of the third rectangle
const width3 = 10;
const height3 = 10;
const area3 =  width3 * height3;
```

In programming, we often use code to perform a specific task multiple
times. Instead of rewriting the same code, we can group a block of code
together and associate it with one task, then we can reuse that block of
code whenever we need to perform the task again. We achieve this by
creating a *function*. A function is a reusable block of code that
groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.

In this lesson, you will learn how to create and use functions, and how
they can be used to create clearer and more concise code.



Take a look at the provided GIF. It shows a function, named
`addOneSide`, adding an additional side to different shape inputs.
Notice how there is only one function, represented by the box, that is
used to transform individual shapes (inputs) into new shapes (outputs).



<img alt="Functions example GIF" src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/functions_2.gif" class="gamut-1h2re45-imageStyles-imageStyles e1xtjyf0">

## Function Declarations

In JavaScript, there are many ways to create a <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/functions?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">function</a>. One way to create a function is by using a
*function declaration*. Just like how a variable declaration binds a
value to a variable name, a function declaration binds a function to a
name, or an *identifier*. Take a look at the anatomy of a function
declaration below:

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/declaration.svg"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="Diagram showing the syntax of a function declaration" />

A function declaration consists of:

- The `function` keyword.
- The name of the function, or its identifier, followed by parentheses.
- A function body, or the block of statements required to perform a
  specific task, enclosed in the function’s curly brackets, `{ }`.

A function declaration is a function that is bound to an identifier, or
name. In the next exercise we’ll go over how to run the code inside the
function body.

We should also be aware of the *hoisting* feature in JavaScript which
allows access to function declarations before they’re defined.

Take a look at example of hoisting:

``` js
greetWorld(); // Output: Hello, World!
 
function greetWorld() {
  console.log('Hello, World!');
}
```

Notice how hoisting allowed `greetWorld()` to be called before the
`greetWorld()` function was defined! Since hoisting isn’t considered
good practice, we simply want you to be aware of this feature.

If you want to read more about hoisting, check out
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDN documentation on hoisting</a>.



**1.**

Let’s create a function that prints a reminder to the console. Using a
function declaration, create a function called `getReminder()`.

**2.**

In the function body of `getReminder()`, log the following reminder to
the console: `'Water the plants.'`

**3.**

Let’s create another function that prints a useful Spanish travel phrase
to the console.

Using a function declaration, create a function called
`greetInSpanish()`.

**4.**

Add code to the function body of `greetInSpanish()`:

- In the function body `console.log()` the following Spanish phrase to
  the console: `'Buenas tardes.'`



``` javascript
function getReminder() {
  console.log('Water the plants.');
}

function greetInSpanish() {
  console.log('Buenas tardes.');
}
```

## Calling a Function

As we saw in previous exercises, a function declaration binds a function
to an identifier.

However, a function declaration does not ask the code inside the
function body to run, it just declares the existence of the function.
The code inside a function body runs, or *executes*, only when the
function is *called*.

To <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/functions?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">call a function</a> in your code, you type the function
name followed by parentheses.

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/name.svg"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="Diagram showing the syntax of invoking a function" />

This *function call* executes the function body, or all of the
statements between the curly braces in the function declaration. <img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/function%20execution.svg%20"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="Function execution diagram" />

We can call the same function as many times as needed.

Let’s practice calling functions in our code.



**1.**

Imagine that you manage an online store. When a customer places an
order, you send them a thank you note. Let’s create a function to
complete this task:

- Define a function called `sayThanks()` as a function declaration.
- In the function body of `sayThanks()`, add code such that the function
  writes the following thank you message to the console when called:
  `'Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your business.'`

**2.**

Call `sayThanks()` to view the thank you message in the console.

**3.**

Functions can be called as many times as you need them.

Imagine that three customers placed an order and you wanted to send each
of them a thank you message. Update your code to call `sayThanks()`
three times.



``` javascript
function sayThanks() {
  console.log('Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your business.');
}

sayThanks();
sayThanks();
sayThanks();
```

    ## Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your business.
    ## Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your business.
    ## Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your business.

## Parameters and Arguments

So far, the functions we’ve created execute a task without an input.
However, some functions can take inputs and use the inputs to perform a
task. When declaring a function, we can specify its *parameters*.
Parameters allow functions to accept input(s) and perform a task using
the input(s). We use parameters as placeholders for information that
will be passed to the function when it is called.

Let’s observe how to specify parameters in our function declaration:

<img
src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/Learn-JavaScript/function_parameters.svg"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="JavaScript syntax for declaring a function with parameters" />

In the diagram above, `calculateArea()`, computes the area of a
rectangle, based on two inputs, `width` and `height`. The parameters are
specified between the parenthesis as `width` and `height`, and inside
the function body, they act just like regular variables. `width` and
`height` act as placeholders for values that will be multiplied
together.

When calling a function that has parameters, we specify the values in
the parentheses that follow the function name. The values that are
passed to the function when it is called are called *arguments*.
Arguments can be passed to the function as values or variables.

<img
src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/Learn-JavaScript/by_value.svg"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="JavaScript syntax for invoking a function with arguments as values" />

In the function call above, the number `10` is passed as the `width` and
`6` is passed as `height`. Notice that the order in which arguments are
passed and assigned follows the order that the parameters are declared.

<img
src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/Learn-JavaScript/by_variable.svg"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="JavaScript syntax for invoking a function with arguments as variables" />

The variables `rectWidth` and `rectHeight` are initialized with the
values for the height and width of a rectangle before being used in the
function call.

By using parameters, `calculateArea()` can be reused to compute the area
of any rectangle! Functions are a powerful tool in computer programming
so let’s practice creating and calling functions with parameters.



**1.**

The `sayThanks()` function works well, but let’s add the customer’s name
in the message.

Add a parameter called `name` to the function declaration for
`sayThanks()`.

**2.**

With `name` as a parameter, it can be used as a variable in the function
body of `sayThanks()`.

Using `name` and string concatenation, change the thank you message into
the following:

``` js
'Thank you for your purchase '+ name + '! We appreciate your business.'
```

Copy and paste the above message into your code.

**3.**

A customer named Cole just purchased something from your online store.
Call `sayThanks()` and pass `'Cole'` as an argument to send Cole a
personalized thank you message.



``` javascript
function sayThanks(name) {
  console.log('Thank you for your purchase ' + name + '! We appreciate your business.');
}

sayThanks('Cole');
```

    ## Thank you for your purchase Cole! We appreciate your business.

## Default Parameters

One of the features added in ES6 is the ability to use *default
parameters*. Default parameters allow parameters to have a predetermined
value in case there is no argument passed into the function or if the
argument is `undefined` when called.

Take a look at the code snippet below that uses a default parameter:

``` js
function greeting (name = 'stranger') {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}
 
greeting('Nick') // Output: Hello, Nick!
greeting() // Output: Hello, stranger!
 
```

- In the example above, we used the `=` operator to assign the parameter
  `name` a default value of `'stranger'`. This is useful to have in case
  we ever want to include a non-personalized default greeting!

- When the code calls `greeting('Nick')` the value of the argument is
  passed in and, `'Nick'`, will override the default parameter of
  `'stranger'` to log `'Hello, Nick!'` to the console.

- When there isn’t an argument passed into `greeting()`, the default
  value of `'stranger'` is used, and `'Hello, stranger!'` is logged to
  the console.

By using a default parameter, we account for situations when an argument
isn’t passed into a function that is expecting an argument.

Let’s practice creating functions that use default parameters.



**1.**

The function `makeShoppingList()` creates a shopping list based on the
items that are passed to the function as arguments.

Imagine that you always purchase milk, bread, and eggs every time you go
shopping for groceries. To make creating a grocery list easier, let’s
assign default values to the parameters in `makeShoppingList()`.

Change the parameters of `makeShoppingList()` into default parameters :

- Assign ‘milk’ as the default value of `item1`.
- Assign ‘bread’ as the default value of `item2`.
- Assign ‘eggs’ as the default value of `item3`.



``` javascript
function makeShoppingList(item1 = 'milk', item2 = 'bread', item3 = 'eggs'){
  console.log(`Remember to buy ${item1}`);
  console.log(`Remember to buy ${item2}`);
  console.log(`Remember to buy ${item3}`);
}
```

## Return

When a function is called, the computer will run through the function’s
code and evaluate the result of calling the function. By default that
resulting value is `undefined`.

``` js
function rectangleArea(width, height) {
  let area = width * height;
}
console.log(rectangleArea(5, 7)) // Prints undefined
```

In the code example, we defined our function to calculate the `area` of
a `width` and `height` parameter. Then `rectangleArea()` is invoked with
the arguments `5` and `7`. But when we went to print the results we got
`undefined`. Did we write our function wrong? No! In fact, the function
worked fine, and the computer did calculate the area as `35`, but we
didn’t capture it. So how can we do that? With the keyword `return`!

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/function%20return.svg"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="using return keyword in a function" />

To pass back information from the function call, we use a <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/functions?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">return statement</a>. To create a return statement, we
use the `return` keyword followed by the value that we wish to return.
Like we saw above, if the value is omitted, `undefined` is returned
instead.

When a `return` statement is used in a function body, the execution of
the function is stopped and the code that follows it will not be
executed. Look at the example below:

``` js
function rectangleArea(width, height) {
  if (width < 0 || height < 0) {
    return 'You need positive integers to calculate area!';
  }
  return width * height;
}
```

If an argument for `width` or `height` is less than `0`, then
`rectangleArea()` will return
`'You need positive integers to calculate area!'`. The second return
statement `width * height` will not run.

The `return` keyword is powerful because it allows functions to produce
an output. We can then save the output to a variable for later use.



**1.**

Imagine if we needed to order monitors for everyone in an office and
this office is conveniently arranged in a grid shape. We could use a
function to help us calculate the number of monitors needed!

Declare a function `monitorCount()` that has two parameters. The first
parameter is `rows` and the second parameter is `columns`.

**2.**

Let’s compute the number of monitors by multiplying `rows` and `columns`
and then returning the value.

In the function body of the function you just wrote, use the `return`
keyword to return `rows * columns`.

**3.**

Now that the function is defined, we can compute the number of monitors
needed. Let’s say that the office has 5 rows and 4 columns.

Declare a variable named `numOfMonitors` using the `const` keyword and
assign `numOfMonitors` the value of invoking `monitorCount()` with the
arguments `5` and `4`.

**4.**

To check that the function worked properly, log `numOfMonitors` to the
console.



``` javascript
function monitorCount(rows, columns) {
  return rows * columns;
}

const numOfMonitors = monitorCount(5, 4);

console.log(numOfMonitors);
```

    ## 20

## Helper Functions

We can also use the return value of a function inside another function.
These functions being called within another function are often referred
to as *helper functions*. Since each function is carrying out a specific
task, it makes our code easier to read and debug if necessary.

If we wanted to define a function that converts the temperature from
Celsius to Fahrenheit, we could write two functions like:

``` js
function multiplyByNineFifths(number) {
  return number * (9/5);
};
 
function getFahrenheit(celsius) {
  return multiplyByNineFifths(celsius) + 32;
};
 
getFahrenheit(15); // Returns 59
```

In the example above:

- `getFahrenheit()` is called and `15` is passed as an argument.
- The code block inside of `getFahrenheit()` calls
  `multiplyByNineFifths()` and passes `15` as an argument.
- `multiplyByNineFifths()` takes the argument of `15` for the `number`
  parameter.
- The code block inside of `multiplyByNineFifths()` function multiplies
  `15` by `(9/5)`, which evaluates to `27`.
- `27` is returned back to the function call in `getFahrenheit()`.
- `getFahrenheit()` continues to execute. It adds `32` to `27`, which
  evaluates to `59`.
- Finally, `59` is returned back to the function call
  `getFahrenheit(15)`.

We can use functions to section off small bits of logic or tasks, then
use them when we need to. Writing helper functions can help take large
and difficult tasks and break them into smaller and more manageable
tasks.



**1.**

In the previous exercise, we created a function to find the number of
monitors to order for an office. Now let’s write another function that
uses the `monitorCount` function to figure out the price.

Below `monitorCount` Create a function declaration named
`costOfMonitors` that has two parameters, the first parameter is `rows`
and the second parameter is `columns`. Leave the function body empty for
now.

**2.**

Time to add some code to the function body of `costOfMonitors` to
calculate the total cost.

Add a `return` statement that returns the value of calling
`monitorCount(rows, columns)` multiplied by `200`.

**3.**

We should save the cost to a variable.

Declare a variable named `totalCost` using the `const` keyword. Assign
to `totalCost` the value of calling `costOfMonitors()` with the
arguments `5` and `4` respectively.

**4.**

To check that the function worked properly, log `totalCost` to the
console.



``` javascript
function monitorCount(rows, columns) {
  return rows * columns;
}

function costOfMonitors(rows, columns) {
 return monitorCount(rows, columns)  * 200;
}

const totalCost = costOfMonitors(5, 4);

console.log(totalCost);
```

    ## 4000

## Function Expressions

Another way to define a function is to use a *function expression*. To
define a function inside an expression, we can use the `function`
keyword. In a function expression, the function name is usually omitted.
A function with no name is called an *anonymous function*. A function
expression is often stored in a variable in order to refer to it.

Consider the following function expression:

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/expression.svg"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="defining a function expression" />

To declare a function expression:

1.  Declare a variable to make the variable’s name be the name, or
    identifier, of your function. Since the release of ES6, it is common
    practice to use `const` as the keyword to declare the variable.

2.  Assign as that variable’s value an anonymous function created by
    using the `function` keyword followed by a set of parentheses with
    possible parameters. Then a set of curly braces that contain the
    function body.

To invoke a function expression, write the name of the variable in which
the function is stored followed by parentheses enclosing any arguments
being passed into the function.

``` js
variableName(argument1, argument2)
```

Unlike function declarations, function expressions are not hoisted so
they cannot be called before they are defined.

Let’s define a new function using a function expression.



**1.**

Let’s say we have a plant that we need to water once a week on
Wednesdays. We could define a function expression to help us check the
day of the week and if the plant needs to be watered:

- Create a variable named `plantNeedsWater` using the `const` variable
  keyword.
- Assign an anonymous function that takes in a parameter of `day` to
  `plantNeedsWater`.

**2.**

Now we need to add some code to the function body of
`plantNeedsWater()`:

- In the function body add an `if` conditional that checks
  `day === 'Wednesday'`.
- If the conditional is truthy, inside the `if` code block, use the
  `return` keyword to return `true`.

**3.**

On days that aren’t `'Wednesday'`, `plantNeedsWater()` should return
`false`:

- Add an `else` statement after the `if` statement.
- Inside the `else` statement use the `return` keyword to return
  `false`.

**4.**

Call the `plantNeedsWater()` and pass in `'Tuesday'` as an argument.

**5.**

Let’s check that `plantNeedsWater()` returned the expected value.

Log `plantNeedsWater('Tuesday')` to the console. If it worked correctly,
you should see `false` logged to the console.



``` javascript
const plantNeedsWater = function(day) {
  if(day === 'Wednesday'){
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};

plantNeedsWater('Tuesday');

console.log(plantNeedsWater('Tuesday'));
```

    ## false

## Arrow Functions

ES6 introduced *arrow function syntax*, a shorter way to write functions
by using the special “fat arrow” `() =>` notation.

<a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrow-functions?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">Arrow functions</a> remove the need to type out the
keyword `function` every time you need to create a function. Instead,
you first include the parameters inside the `( )` and then add an arrow
`=>` that points to the function body surrounded in `{ }` like this:

``` js
const rectangleArea = (width, height) => {
  let area = width * height;
  return area;
};
```

It’s important to be familiar with the multiple ways of writing
functions because you will come across each of these when reading other
JavaScript code.



**1.**

Change `plantNeedsWater()` to use arrow function syntax.



``` javascript
const plantNeedsWater = (day) => {
  if (day === 'Wednesday') {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};
```

## Concise Body Arrow Functions

JavaScript also provides several ways to refactor <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrow-functions?page_ref=catalog"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">arrow function</a> syntax. The most condensed form of
the function is known as *concise body*. We’ll explore a few of these
techniques below:

1.  Functions that take only a single parameter do not need that
    parameter to be enclosed in parentheses. However, if a function
    takes zero or multiple parameters, parentheses are required.

    <img
    src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/parameters.svg"
    class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
    alt="showcasing how arrow functions parameters differ for different amounts of parameters" />

2.  A function body composed of a single-line block does not need curly
    braces. Without the curly braces, whatever that line evaluates will
    be automatically returned. The contents of the block should
    immediately follow the arrow `=>` and the `return` keyword can be
    removed. This is referred to as *implicit return*.

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/return.svg"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="comparing single line and multiline arrow functions" />

So if we have a function:

``` js
const squareNum = (num) => {
  return num * num;
};
```

We can refactor the function to:

``` js
const squareNum = num => num * num;
```

Notice the following changes:

- The parentheses around `num` have been removed, since it has a single
  parameter.
- The curly braces `{ }` have been removed since the function consists
  of a single-line block.
- The `return` keyword has been removed since the function consists of a
  single-line block.



**1.**

Let’s refactor `plantNeedsWater()` to be a concise body. Notice that
we’ve already converted the `if`/`else` statement to a ternary operator
to make the code fit on one line.



``` javascript
const plantNeedsWater = day => day === 'Wednesday' ? true : false;
```

## Review Functions

Give yourself a pat on the back, you just navigated through functions!

In this lesson, we covered some important concepts about functions:

- A *function* is a reusable block of code that groups together a
  sequence of statements to perform a specific task.

- A *function declaration* :

  <img
  src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/declaration.svg"
  class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
  alt="Diagram showing the syntax of a function declaration" />

<!-- -->

- A parameter is a named variable inside a function’s block which will
  be assigned the value of the argument passed in when the function is
  invoked:

  <img
  src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/function_parameters.svg"
  class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
  alt="JavaScript syntax for declaring a function with parameters" />

- To *call* a function in your code:

  <img
  src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/name.svg"
  class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
  alt="Diagram showing the syntax of invoking a function" />

- ES6 introduces new ways of handling arbitrary parameters through
  *default parameters* which allow us to assign a default value to a
  parameter in case no argument is passed into the function.

- To return a value from a function, we use a *return statement*.

- To define a function using *function expressions*:

  <img
  src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/expression.svg"
  class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
  alt="defining a function expression" />

- To define a function using *arrow function notation*:

  <img
  src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/arrow_notation.svg"
  class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" />

- Function definition can be made concise using concise arrow notation:

  <img
  src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/return.svg"
  class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
  alt="comparing single line and multiline arrow functions" />

It’s good to be aware of the differences between function expressions,
arrow functions, and function declarations. As you program more in
JavaScript, you’ll see a wide variety of how these function types are
used.

# Rock, Paper, or Scissors

Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses
either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever
player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

- Rock destroys scissors.
- Scissors cut paper.
- Paper covers rock.
- If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

Our code will break the game into four parts:

1.  Get the user’s choice.
2.  Get the computer’s choice.
3.  Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
4.  Start the program and display the results.

If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced
developer work through it, click “**Get Unstuck**“ to see a **project
walkthrough video**.



Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off

1\.

The user should be able to choose ‘rock’, ‘paper’, or ‘scissors’ when
the game starts.

Using `const` and arrow function syntax, create a function named
`getUserChoice` that takes a single parameter `userInput`.

2\.

Since a user can pass in a parameter, such as ‘Rock’ or ‘rock’ with
different capitalizations, begin by utilizing JavaScript’s
`toLowerCase()` function to make the `userInput` all lowercase.

You can use code like this:

``` js
userInput = userInput.toLowerCase();
```

3\.

When getting the user’s choice, you should also check to make sure that
the user typed a valid choice: ‘rock’, ‘paper’, or ‘scissors’.

Inside `getUserChoice()`, write an `if`/`else` statement that makes sure
the `userInput` is either `'rock'`, `'paper'`, or `'scissors'`. If it
does, then `return` the `userInput`. If not, use `console.log` to print
an error message to the console.

4\.

Test the function by calling it with valid and invalid input, and
printing the results to the console.

You can delete this when you know your function works.

5\.

Now we need to have the computer make a choice.

Create a new function named `getComputerChoice` with no parameters.
Inside its block, utilize `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` to get a
whole number between 0 and 2. Then, depending on the number, `return`
either `'rock'`, `'paper'`, or `'scissors'`.

6\.

Test the function by calling it multiple times and printing the results
to the console.

You can delete this when you know your function works.

7\.

Now it’s time to determine a winner.

Create a function named `determineWinner` that takes two parameters
named `userChoice` and `computerChoice`. This function will compare the
two choices played and then `return` if the human player won, lost, or
tied.

Let’s deal with the tie condition first. Within the `determineWinner()`
function, write an `if` statement that checks if the `userChoice`
parameter equals the `computerChoice` parameter. If so, `return` a
string that the game was a tie.

8\.

If the game is not a tie, you’ll need to determine a winner.

Begin by writing an `if` statement that checks if the `userChoice` is
`'rock'`. Inside the `if` statement’s block, write another `if`/`else`
statement. The inner `if`/`else` should check if the `computerChoice` is
`'paper'`. If so, `return` a message that the computer won. If not,
`return` a message that the user won.

9\.

Next, write another `if` statement for if the `userChoice` is `'paper'`.

Inside this `if` statement, the `computerChoice` must be either
`'scissors'` or `'rock'`. Write logic that will `return` a winner.

10\.

Next, write yet another `if` statement for if the `userChoice` is
`'scissors'`.

Inside of this `if` statement, the `computerChoice` must either be
`'rock'` or `'paper'`. Write logic that will `return` a winner.

11\.

Don’t forget to test your function!

Check off this task when you’ve finished testing.

12\.

Everything is set up. Now you need to start the game and log the
results.

Create a function named `playGame`.

Inside the `playGame()` function, create a variable named `userChoice`
set equal to the result of calling `getUserChoice()`, passing in either
`'rock'`, `'paper'`, or `'scissors'` as an argument.

Create another variable named `computerChoice`, and set it equal to the
result of calling `getComputerChoice()`.

Under both of these variables, use `console.log` to print them to the
console.

13\.

Finally, let’s determine who won.

Inside the `playGame()` function, call the `determineWinner()` function.
Pass in the `userChoice` and `computerChoice` variables as its
parameters. Make sure to put this function call inside of a
`console.log()` statement so you can see the result.

Then, to start the game, call the `playGame()` function on the last line
of your program.

14\.

Make this game better by adding a secret cheat code. If a user types
`'bomb'` as their choice, then make sure they win, no matter what.

## [Solution](rock-paper-scissors-javascript)

``` javascript
console.log("hi");

const getUserChoice = (userInput) => {
  userInput = userInput.toLowerCase();
  if (
    userInput === "rock" ||
    userInput === "paper" ||
    userInput === "scissors" ||
    userInput === "bomb"
  ) {
    return userInput;
  } else {
    console.log("This is not a valid entry.");
  }
};

const getComputerChoice = () => {
  let randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
  //console.log(randomNum);
  if (randomNum === 0) {
    return "rock";
  } else if (randomNum === 1) {
    return "paper";
  } else {
    return "scissors";
  }
};

const determineWinner = (userChoice, computerChoice) => {
  if (userChoice === computerChoice) {
    return "It's a tie!";
  }

  if (userChoice === "rock") {
    if (computerChoice === "paper") {
      return "The computer wins!";
    } else {
      return "You win!";
    }
  }

  if (userChoice === "paper") {
    if (computerChoice === "scissors") {
      return "The computer wins!";
    } else {
      return "You win!";
    }
  }

  if (userChoice === "scissors") {
    if (computerChoice === "rock") {
      return "The computer wins!";
    } else {
      return "You win!";
    }
  }

  if (userChoice === "bomb") {
    return "You've won in an explosive decision!";
  }
};

function playGame() {
  let userChoice = getUserChoice("scissors");
  let computerChoice = getComputerChoice();
  console.log(userChoice);
  console.log(computerChoice);
  console.log(determineWinner(userChoice, computerChoice));
}

playGame();
```

    ## hi
    ## scissors
    ## scissors
    ## It's a tie!

# Sleep Debt Calculator

Did you know that giraffes sleep <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe#Legs,_locomotion_and_posture%0A"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.6 hours a day</a>? We humans need more
than that. If we don’t sleep enough, we accumulate sleep debt. In this
project we’ll calculate if you’re getting enough sleep each week using a
sleep debt calculator.

The program will determine the actual and ideal hours of sleep for each
night of the last week.

Finally, it will calculate, in hours, how far you are from your weekly
sleep goal.

If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced
developer work through it, click “**Get Unstuck**“ to see a **project
walkthrough video**.



Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off

1\.

The first problem to solve is determining how many hours of sleep you
got each night of the week.

You can create a function that returns any given night’s number of hours
of rest. Instead of writing seven different functions (one for each day
of the week), let’s write one function with a parameter for the day.

Create a function named `getSleepHours` with a single parameter named
`day`.

2\.

The function should accept a day as an argument and return the number of
hours you slept that night.

For instance, if you got 8 hours of sleep on Monday night, calling
`getSleepHours('monday')` should return `8`.

Use an `if/else` or `switch` statement to implement this.

3\.

Test the function by calling it multiple times and printing the results
to the console.

You can remove the tests when you know your function works.

4\.

Now that you’ve written a function to get the sleep hours for each
night, we need to do three things:

- Get the total sleep hours that you actually slept
- Get the ideal sleep hours that you prefer
- Calculate the sleep debt, if any.

To get the total sleep hours that you actually slept, create a new
function named `getActualSleepHours` that takes no parameters.

5\.

Inside the `getActualSleepHours()` function, call the `getSleepHours()`
function for each day of the week. Add the results together and return
the sum using an implicit `return`.

6\.

To get the ideal sleep hours that you prefer, create a function named
`getIdealSleepHours` with no parameters.

Inside the function, declare a variable named `idealHours` and set its
value to your ideal hours per night. Then `return` the `idealHours`
multiplied by 7.

You’ll want to multiply by 7 to get the total hours you prefer per week.

7\.

Test your two new functions by calling them and printing the results to
the console.

You can remove the tests when you know your functions works.

8\.

Now that you can get the actual sleep hours and the ideal sleep hours,
it’s time to calculate sleep debt.

Create a function named `calculateSleepDebt` with no parameters.

Inside of its block, create a variable named `actualSleepHours` set
equal to the `getActualSleepHours()` function call.

Then, create another variable named `idealSleepHours`, set equal to the
`getIdealSleepHours()` function call.

9\.

Now that you have `actualSleepHours` and `idealSleepHours`, you can
write a few `if`/`else` statements to output the result to the console.
The function should fulfill this logic:

- If actual sleep equals ideal sleep, log to the console that the user
  got the perfect amount of sleep.
- If the actual sleep is greater than the ideal sleep, log to the
  console that the user got more sleep than needed.
- If the actual sleep is less than the ideal sleep, log to the console
  that the user should get some rest.

10\.

To make this calculator more helpful, add the hours the user is over or
under their ideal sleep in each log statement in `calculateSleepDebt()`.

11\.

On the last line of the program, start the program by calling the
`calculateSleepDebt()` function.

12\.

For extra practice, try these:

- `getActualSleepHours()` could be implemented without calling
  `getSleepHours()`. Use literal numbers and the `+` operator to rewrite
  `getActualSleepHours()`. It should still return the total actual hours
  slept in the week.

- Some people need to sleep longer than others. Rewrite
  `getIdealSleepHours()` so that you can pass it an argument, like
  `getIdealSleepHours(8)` where `8` is the ideal hours per night. Update
  the call to `getIdealSleepHours()` in `calculateSleepDebt()` too.

To see the solutions, open the hint.

## [Solution](sleep-debt-calculator)

``` javascript
function getSleepHours(day) {
  switch (day) {
    case "Monday":
      return 8;
      break;
    case "Tuesday":
      return 6;
      break;
    case "Wednesday":
      return 7;
      break;
    case "Thursday":
      return 8;
      break;
    case "Friday":
      return 6;
      break;
    case "Saturday":
      return 5;
      break;
    case "Sunday":
      return 8;
      break;
  }
}

const getActualSleepHours = () =>
  getSleepHours("Monday") +
  getSleepHours("Tuesday") +
  getSleepHours("Wednesday") +
  getSleepHours("Thursday") +
  getSleepHours("Friday") +
  getSleepHours("Saturday") +
  getSleepHours("Sunday");

const getIdealSleepHours = (hours) => {
  return hours * 7;
};

const calculateSleepDebt = () => {
  let actualSleepHours = getActualSleepHours();
  let idealSleepHours = getIdealSleepHours(8);

  console.log("Amount slept this week: " + actualSleepHours);
  console.log("Ideal amount of sleep for the week: " + idealSleepHours);

  if (actualSleepHours === idealSleepHours) {
    console.log("You got the perfect amount of sleep!");
  } else if (actualSleepHours > idealSleepHours) {
    console.log(
      "You got more sleep than needed. You slept " +
        (actualSleepHours - idealSleepHours) +
        " more hours than your ideal amount."
    );
  } else {
    console.log(
      "You should get some more rest. You slept " +
        (idealSleepHours - actualSleepHours) +
        " hours less than your ideal amount."
    );
  }
};

calculateSleepDebt();
```

    ## Amount slept this week: 48
    ## Ideal amount of sleep for the week: 56
    ## You should get some more rest. You slept 8 hours less than your ideal amount.

# Scope

## Scope

An important idea in programming is *scope*. Scope defines where
variables can be accessed or referenced. While some variables can be
accessed from anywhere within a program, other variables may only be
available in a specific context.

You can think of scope like the view of the night sky from your window.
Everyone who lives on the planet Earth is in the global scope of the
stars. The stars are accessible *globally*. Meanwhile, if you live in a
city, you may see the city skyline or the river. The skyline and river
are only accessible *locally* in your city, but you can still see the
stars that are available globally.

Over the next few exercises, we’ll explore how scope relates to
variables and learn best practices for variable declaration.



Go to the next exercise to learn more about scope.



<img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-scope/scope.svg" alt="a city skyline silhouetted against the night sky" class="gamut-1h2re45-imageStyles-imageStyles e1xtjyf0">

## Blocks and Scope

Before we talk more about scope, we first need to talk about *blocks*.

We’ve seen blocks used before in functions and `if` statements. A block
is the code found inside a set of curly braces `{}`. Blocks help us
group one or more statements together and serve as an important
structural marker for our code.

A block of code could be a function, like this:

``` js
const logSkyColor = () => {
  let color = 'blue'; 
  console.log(color); // blue 
}
```

Notice that the function body is actually a block of code.

Observe the block in an `if` statement:

``` js
if (dusk) {
  let color = 'pink';
  console.log(color); // pink
}
```

In the next few exercises, we’ll see how blocks define the scope of
variables.



**1.**

At the top of **main.js**, declare a `const` variable, named `city` set
equal to `'New York City'`. This variable will exist *outside* of the
block.

**2.**

Below the `city` variable, write a function named `logCitySkyline`.

**3.**

Inside of the function body of `logCitySkyline()`, write another
variable using `let` named `skyscraper` and set it equal to
`'Empire State Building'`.

**4.**

Inside the function, include a return statement like this:

``` js
return 'The stars over the ' + skyscraper + ' in ' + city;
```

**5.**

Beneath the `logCitySkyline()` function, use `console.log()` to log the
value of `logCitySkyline()` to the console.

You’ll notice that the `logCitySkyline()` function is able to access
both variables without any problems. In the next exercise we’ll consider
why would it be preferable to have one variable outside of a block and
the other inside of a block.



``` javascript
const city = 'New York City';

const logCitySkyline = () => {
  let skyscraper = 'Empire State Building';
  return 'The stars over the ' + skyscraper + ' in ' + city;
};

console.log(logCitySkyline());
```

    ## The stars over the Empire State Building in New York City

## Global Scope

Scope is the context in which our variables are declared. We think about
scope in relation to blocks because variables can exist either outside
of or within these blocks.

In *global scope*, variables are declared outside of blocks. These
variables are called *global variables*. Because global variables are
not bound inside a block, they can be accessed by any code in the
program, including code in blocks.

Let’s take a look at an example of global scope:

``` js
const color = 'blue';
 
const returnSkyColor = () => {
  return color; // blue 
};
 
console.log(returnSkyColor()); // blue
```

- Even though the `color` variable is defined outside of the block, it
  can be accessed in the function block, giving it global scope.
- In turn, `color` can be accessed within the `returnSkyColor` function
  block.

Let’s work with global variables to see how data can be accessible from
any place within a program.



**1.**

At the top of **main.js**, write three global variables:

- Name the first variable `satellite` and set it equal to `'The Moon'`.
- Name the second variable `galaxy` and set it equal to
  `'The Milky Way'`.
- Name the third variable `stars` and set it equal to `'North Star'`.

**2.**

Below the variables created in the previous step, write a function named
`callMyNightSky`. Inside the function, include a return statement like
this:

``` js
return 'Night Sky: ' + satellite + ', ' + stars + ', and ' + galaxy;
```

**3.**

Beneath the `callMyNightSky()` function, use `console.log()` to log the
value of `callMyNightSky()` to the console.

You’ll notice that the function block for `callMyNightSky()` is able to
access the global variables freely since the variables are available to
all lines of code in the file.



``` javascript
const satellite = 'The Moon';
const galaxy = 'The Milky Way';
const stars = 'North Star';

const callMyNightSky = () => {
    return 'Night Sky: ' + satellite + ', ' + stars + ', and ' + galaxy;
};

console.log(callMyNightSky());
```

    ## Night Sky: The Moon, North Star, and The Milky Way

## Block Scope

The next context we’ll cover is *block scope*. When a variable is
defined inside a block, it is only accessible to the code within the
curly braces `{}`. We say that variable has *block scope* because it is
*only* accessible to the lines of code within that block.

Variables that are declared with block scope are known as *local
variables* because they are only available to the code that is part of
the same block.

Block scope works like this:

``` js
const logSkyColor = () => {
  let color = 'blue'; 
  console.log(color); // Prints "blue"
};
 
logSkyColor(); // Prints "blue"
console.log(color); // throws a ReferenceError
```

You’ll notice:

- We define a function `logSkyColor()`.
- Within the function, the `color` variable is only available within the
  curly braces of the function.
- If we try to log the same variable outside the function, it throws a
  `ReferenceError`.



**1.**

In **main.js**, define a function `logVisibleLightWaves()`.

**2.**

Within the `logVisibleLightWaves()` function, using `const`, create a
variable `lightWaves` and set it equal to `'Moonlight'`.

**3.**

Within the `logVisibleLightWaves()` function, beneath the `lightWaves`
variable, add a `console.log()` statement that will log the value of the
`lightWaves` variable when the function runs.

**4.**

Call the `logVisibleLightWaves()` function from outside the function.

**5.**

Beneath the function call, log the value of `lightWaves` to the console
from outside the function.

You’ll notice that it logs a `ReferenceError` since the variable is tied
to the block scope of the function!



``` javascript
const logVisibleLightWaves = () => {
  const lightWaves = 'Moonlight';
  console.log(lightWaves);
};

logVisibleLightWaves();

// console.log(lightWaves);
```

    ## Moonlight

## Scope Pollution

It may seem like a great idea to always make your variables accessible,
but having too many global variables can cause problems in a program.

When you declare global variables, they go to the *global namespace*.
The global namespace allows the variables to be accessible from anywhere
in the program. These variables remain there until the program finishes
which means our global namespace can fill up really quickly.

*Scope pollution* is when we have too many global variables that exist
in the global namespace, or when we reuse variables across different
scopes. Scope pollution makes it difficult to keep track of our
different variables and sets us up for potential accidents. For example,
globally scoped variables can collide with other variables that are more
locally scoped, causing unexpected behavior in our code.

Let’s look at an example of scope pollution in practice so we know how
to avoid it:

``` js
let num = 50;
 
const logNum = () => {
  num = 100; // Take note of this line of code
  console.log(num);
};
 
logNum(); // Prints 100
console.log(num); // Prints 100
```

You’ll notice:

- We have a variable `num`.
- Inside the function body of `logNum()`, we want to declare a new
  variable but forgot to use the `let` keyword.
- When we call `logNum()`, `num` gets reassigned to `100`.
- The reassignment inside `logNum()` affects the global variable `num`.
- Even though the reassignment is allowed and we won’t get an error, if
  we decided to use `num` later, we’ll unknowingly use the new value of
  `num`.

While it’s important to know what global scope is, it’s best practice to
not define variables in the global scope.



**1.**

Let’s see what happens if we create a variable that overwrites a global
variable.

Inside the `callMyNightSky()` function, on the very first line of the
function body, assign the variable `stars` to `'Sirius'` as such:

``` js
stars = 'Sirius';
```

**2.**

Outside the function, under the current `console.log()` statement, add
another `console.log()` statement to log `stars` to the console.

You’ll notice that the global variable `stars` was reassigned to
`'Sirius'`. In other words, we changed the value of the global `stars`
variable but it’s not easy to read what exactly happened. This is bad
practice in code maintainability and could impact our program in ways we
do not intend.



``` javascript
const satellite = 'The Moon';
const galaxy = 'The Milky Way';
let stars = 'North Star';

const callMyNightSky = () => {
  stars = 'Sirius';
    return 'Night Sky: ' + satellite + ', ' + stars + ', ' + galaxy;
};

console.log(callMyNightSky());
console.log(stars);
```

    ## Night Sky: The Moon, Sirius, The Milky Way
    ## Sirius

## Practice Good Scoping

Given the challenges with global variables and scope pollution, we
should follow best practices for scoping our variables as tightly as
possible using block scope.

Tightly scoping your variables will greatly improve your code in several
ways:

- It will make your code more legible since the blocks will organize
  your code into discrete sections.
- It makes your code more understandable since it clarifies which
  variables are associated with different parts of the program rather
  than having to keep track of them line after line!
- It’s easier to maintain your code, since your code will be modular.
- It will save memory in your code because it will cease to exist after
  the block finishes running.

Here’s another example of how to use block scope, as defined within an
`if` block:

``` js
const logSkyColor = () => {
  const dusk = true;
  let color = 'blue'; 
  if (dusk) {
    let color = 'pink';
    console.log(color); // Prints "pink"
  }
  console.log(color); // Prints "blue"
};
 
console.log(color); // throws a ReferenceError
```

Here, you’ll notice:

- We create a variable `dusk` inside the `logSkyColor()` function.
- After the `if` statement, we define a new code block with the `{}`
  braces. Here we assign a new value to the variable `color` if the `if`
  statement is truthy.
- Within the `if` block, the `color` variable holds the value `'pink'`,
  though outside the `if` block, in the function body, the `color`
  variable holds the value `'blue'`.
- While we use block scope, we still pollute our namespace by reusing
  the same variable name twice. A better practice would be to rename the
  variable inside the block.

Block scope is a powerful tool in JavaScript, since it allows us to
define variables with precision, and not pollute the global namespace.
If a variable does not need to exist outside a block— it shouldn’t!



**1.**

Inside the function body of `logVisibleLightWaves()`, beneath the
`region` variable and before the provided `console.log()` statement,
create an `if` statement that checks if the `region` is the
`'The Arctic'`.

**2.**

Inside the `if` block, define a new `let` variable `lightWaves` and set
it equal to `'Northern Lights'`.

**3.**

Beneath the variable in the `if` block, use `console.log()` to log the
value of the block variable inside the `if` block.

Run your code and notice the output. Inside the `if` block
`console.log(lightWaves)` logs the value `Northern Lights` to the
console. Outside the `if` block, but still within the function, the same
statement logs `Moonlight` to the console.



``` javascript
const logVisibleLightWaves = () => {
  let lightWaves = 'Moonlight';
    let region = 'The Arctic';
  // Add if statement here:
  if (region === 'The Arctic'){
    let lightWaves = 'Northern Lights';
    console.log(lightWaves);
  }
  
  console.log(lightWaves);
};

logVisibleLightWaves();
```

    ## Northern Lights
    ## Moonlight

## Review: Scope

In this lesson, you learned about scope and how it impacts the
accessibility of different variables.

Let’s review the following terms:

- **Scope** refers to where variables can be accessed throughout the
  program, and is determined by where and how they are declared.
- **Blocks** are statements that exist within curly braces `{}`.
- **Global scope** refers to the context within which variables are
  accessible to every part of the program.
- **Global variables** are variables that exist within global scope.
- **Block scope** refers to the context within which variables are
  accessible only within the block they are defined.
- **Local variables** are variables that exist within block scope.
- **Global namespace** is the space in our code that contains globally
  scoped information.
- **Scope pollution** is when too many variables exist in a namespace or
  variable names are reused.

As you continue your coding journey, remember to use best practices when
declaring your variables! Scoping your variables tightly will ensure
that your code has clean, organized, and modular logic.

# Training Days

As a seasoned athlete, one of your favorite activities is running
marathons. You use a service called Training Days that sends you a
message for the event you signed up for and the days you have left to
train.

Since you also code, Training Days has asked you to help them solve a
problem: The program currently uses the wrong scope for its variables.
They know this can be troublesome as their service evolves. In this
project you will make Training Days more maintainable and less
error-prone by fixing variable scopes.

If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced
developer work through it, click “**Get Unstuck**“ to see a **project
walkthrough video**.



Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off

1\.

Let’s begin by running the **trainingDays.js** file. In the console we
can see that the program is broken!

Ideally, the `getRandEvent()` function selects an event at random. The
`getTrainingDays()` function returns the number of days to train based
on the event selected. The `logEvent()` and `logTime()` functions print
the athlete name, event, and number of days to the console.

But poorly scoped variables are causing errors.

## Expand days scope

2\.

To avoid the `ReferenceError`, declare `days` within the
`getTrainingDays` function, before the `if` statement.

3\.

Run the program again: no error, but `days` is `undefined`! New `days`
variables are being defined in the scope of each `if`/`else if`
statement.

Delete the three `let`’s within the `if`/`else if` statements.

4\.

Run the program again: fixed! Now the `if`/`else if` statements are
changing the original `days` rather than defining a new one.

## Make name global

5\.

The `log` functions–`logEvent()` and `logTime()`–use the same `name`
variable. There seems to be a problem with the scoping; we can tell by
the amount of duplicate code here! In addition to variables scoped too
broadly, duplicate code can indicate that a variable may be scoped too
tightly.

Let’s avoid this repetition by adding `name` as the first parameter for
each function.

6\.

Move the `name` variable to global scope.

7\.

Pass `name` as the first argument to `logEvent()` and `logTime()`.

8\.

Check that the program still works! Run it and check the output.

## Make random local

9\.

Try the functions for another competitor. Copy and paste this code at
the end of the file.

``` js
const event2 = getRandEvent();
const days2 = getTrainingDays(event2);
const name2 = 'Warren';
 
logEvent(name2, event2);
logTime(name2, days2);
```

10\.

Run the program. The events are assigned randomly, but Nala and Warren
are running the same events!

11\.

We see that the `random` variable is defined in the global scope. Each
time `getRandEvent()` is called, it uses the same value.

At the top of the file, move the `random` variable from the global scope
to block scope within the `getRandEvent` function.

12\.

Well done! Training Days is more maintainable and less error-prone
thanks to your work. Run the program a few times to make sure the
results are randomized.

## [Solution](training-days)

``` javascript
// The scope of `random` is too loose

const getRandEvent = () => {
  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
  if (random === 0) {
    return "Marathon";
  } else if (random === 1) {
    return "Triathlon";
  } else if (random === 2) {
    return "Pentathlon";
  }
};

// The scope of `days` is too tight
const getTrainingDays = (event) => {
  let days;

  if (event === "Marathon") {
    days = 50;
  } else if (event === "Triathlon") {
    days = 100;
  } else if (event === "Pentathlon") {
    days = 200;
  }

  return days;
};

const name = "Nala";

// The scope of `name` is too tight
const logEvent = (name, event) => {
  console.log(`${name}'s event is: ${event}`);
};

const logTime = (name, days) => {
  console.log(`${name}'s time to train is: ${days} days`);
};

const event = getRandEvent();
const days = getTrainingDays(event);
// Define a `name` variable. Use it as an argument after updating logEvent and logTime

logEvent(name, event);
logTime(name, days);

const event2 = getRandEvent();
const days2 = getTrainingDays(event2);
const name2 = "Warren";

logEvent(name2, event2);
logTime(name2, days2);
```

    ## Nala's event is: Triathlon
    ## Nala's time to train is: 100 days
    ## Warren's event is: Marathon
    ## Warren's time to train is: 50 days

# Code Challenges: JavaScript Fundamentals

## Introduction

You know a bunch about JavaScript syntax, <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/control-flow/exercises/control-flow-intro"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">control flow</a>, and <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/functions/exercises/intro-to-functions"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">functions</a>! The best way to reinforce these skills is
through practice. We’ve created a series of problems designed to use
your JavaScript knowledge. We encourage you to review relevant lessons,
look things up in the <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a>, check out the hints
and solution code if you get stuck, and, most of all, have fun!

The tasks provided are designed to be challenging. Throughout this code
challenge, we’ll be running tests to check that the functions you write
are working correctly. We’ll often provide some example code to test
your function. We encourage you to write additional code to test your
functions. To pass our tests, your function will need to work as
described in the prompt. This means your function may seem to be passing
when you run it, but it will still fail the test because it doesn’t run
as expected in every situation we’re testing behind the scenes. Take
special note of strings—strings must be *identical* to that requested to
pass!



**1.**

Write a function, `greetWorld()`. Your function should have no
parameters and return the string `'Hello, World!'`.

Helpful Notes:

- Your function can be a function expression or a function declaration.
- Notice that the prompt requires your function to *return* the
  string—it will not pass the test if the string is printed to the
  console rather than returned.
- Your code must return `'Hello, World!'` *exactly*. The test will not
  pass with the following strings: `'hello, world!'`, `'Hello, world!'`,
  `'Hello World!'`, `'Hello World'`, `'Hello, World.'`, etc.



``` javascript
// Write your function here:

const greetWorld = () => {
  return "Hello, World!";
};




//Write code to test your function. Even if we provide code to test your function, you should add further tests to make sure your function works correctly in all the specified situations

console.log(greetWorld());
```

    ## Hello, World!

## canIVote()



**1.**

The most common minimum age to vote is 18. Write a function `canIVote()`
that takes in a number, representing the person’s age, and returns the
boolean `true` if they are 18 years old or older, and the boolean
`false` if they are not.



``` javascript
const canIVote = age => {
    if (age >= 18) {
        return true
    } else {
        return false
    }
}
/*
// Alternate solutions:

// As a function declaration:
function canIVote(age) {
    if (age >= 18) {
        return true
    } else {
        return false
    }
}

// Using a ternary:
const canIVote = (age) => age >= 18 ? true : false
*/

console.log(canIVote(19))
```

    ## true

## agreeOrDisagree()



**1.**

Write a function, `agreeOrDisagree()`, that takes in two strings, and
returns `'You agree!'` if the two strings are the same and
`'You disagree!'` if the two strings are different.



``` javascript
const agreeOrDisagree = (first, second) => {
    if (first === second) {
        return 'You agree!'
    } else {
        return 'You disagree!'
    }
}
/*
// As a function declaration:
function agreeOrDisagree(first, second) {
   if (first === second) {
        return 'You agree!'
    } else {
        return 'You disagree!'
    }
}

// As a ternary: 
const agreeOrDisagree = (first, second) => (first === second) ? 'You agree!' : 'You disagree!'
*/

console.log(agreeOrDisagree("yep", "yep")) 
```

    ## You agree!

## lifePhase()



**1.**

Write a function, `lifePhase()`, that takes in a person’s `age`, as a
number, and returns which phase of life they are in.

Here are the classifications:  
0-3 should return `'baby'`  
4-12 should return `'child'`  
13-19 should return `'teen'`  
20-64 should return `'adult'`  
65-140 should return `'senior citizen'`  
If the number is less than 0 or greater than 140, the program should
return `'This is not a valid age'`



``` javascript
const lifePhase = age => {
    if (age < 0 || age > 140) {
        return 'This is not a valid age'
    } else if (age < 4) {
        return 'baby'
    } else if (age < 13) {
        return 'child'
    } else if (age < 20) {
        return 'teen'
    } else if (age < 65) {
        return 'adult'
    } else {
        return 'senior citizen'
    }
}
/*
// As a function declaration:
function lifePhase (age) {
    if (age < 0 || age > 140) {
       return 'This is not a valid age'
   } else if (age < 4) {
        return 'baby'
    } else if (age < 13) {
        return 'child'
    } else if (age < 20) {
       return 'teen'
    } else if (age < 65) {
       return 'adult'
    } else {
        return 'senior citizen'
    }  
}
*/
console.log(lifePhase(5)) 
```

## finalGrade()



**1.**

Write a function, `finalGrade()`. It should:

- take three arguments of type number
- find the `average` of those three numbers
- return the letter grade (as a string) that the `average` corresponds
  to
- return ‘You have entered an invalid grade.’ if any of the three grades
  are less than 0 or greater than 100

0-59 should return: `'F'`  
60-69 should return: `'D'`  
70-79 should return: `'C'`  
80-89 should return: `'B'`  
90-100 should return: `'A'`



``` javascript
const finalGrade = (midterm, final, homework) => {
    if ((midterm < 0 || midterm > 100) || (final < 0 || final > 100) || (homework < 0 || homework > 100)) {
        return 'You have entered an invalid grade.'
    }
    let average = (midterm + final + homework) / 3
    if (average < 60) {
        return 'F'
    }
    else if (average < 70) {
        return 'D'
    }
    else if (average < 80) {
        return 'C'
    }
    else if (average < 90) {
        return 'B'
    } else {
        return 'A'
    }
}

/*
//as a function declaration:
function finalGrade(midterm, final, homework) {
    if ((midterm < 0 || midterm > 100) || (final < 0 || final > 100) || (homework < 0 || homework > 100)) {
        return 'You have entered an invalid grade.'
    }
    let average = (midterm + final + homework) / 3
    if (average < 60) {
        return 'F'
    }
    else if (average < 70) {
        return 'D'
    }
    else if (average < 80) {
        return 'C'
    }
    else if (average < 90) {
        return 'B'
    } else {
        return 'A'
    }
}
*/
```

## reportingForDuty()



**1.**

Write a function, `reportingForDuty()`, that has two string parameters,
`rank` and `lastName`, and returns a string in the following format:
‘rank lastName reporting for duty!’

``` js
reportingForDuty('Private', 'Fido') 
// Should return 'Private Fido reporting for duty!'
```



``` javascript
const reportingForDuty = (rank, lastName) => `${rank} ${lastName} reporting for duty!`

/*
// Using string concatenation:
const reportingForDuty = (rank, lastName) => rank + " " + lastName + " " + "reporting for duty!"

// As a function declaration:
function reportingForDuty(rank, lastName) {
    return `${rank} ${lastName} reporting for duty!`
}
*/
```

## Fix The Broken Code



**1.**

We wrote a function, `rollTheDice()`, which is supposed to simulate two
dice being rolled and totalled. It’s close to doing what we want, but
there’s something not quite right. Can you fix our code, please?



``` javascript
const rollTheDice = () => {
    let die1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6 + 1)
    let die2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6 + 1)
    return die1 + die2
} 
```

## calculateWeight()



**1.**

Though an object’s mass remains consistent throughout the universe,
weight is determined by the force of gravity on an object. Since
different planets have different gravity, the same object would weigh
different amounts on each of those planets! Cool, huh?

Write a function, `calculateWeight()`. It should:

- have two parameters: `earthWeight` and `planet`
- expect `earthWeight` to be a number
- expect `planet` to be a string
- return a number representing what that Earth-weight would equate to on
  the `planet` passed in.

Handle the following cases:  
`'Mercury'` weight = `earthWeight` \* 0.378  
`'Venus'` weight = `earthWeight` \* 0.907  
`'Mars'` weight = `earthWeight` \* 0.377  
`'Jupiter'` weight = `earthWeight` \* 2.36  
`'Saturn'` weight = `earthWeight` \* 0.916  
For all other inputs, return
`'Invalid Planet Entry. Try: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn.'`



``` javascript
const calculateWeight = (earthWeight, planet) => {
    switch (planet) {
        case 'Mercury':
            return earthWeight * .378;
        case 'Venus':
            return earthWeight * .907;
        case 'Mars':
            return earthWeight * .377;
        case 'Jupiter':
            return earthWeight * 2.36;
        case 'Saturn':
            return earthWeight * .916;
        default:
            return 'Invalid Planet Entry. Try: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn.'
    }
}
/*
// As a function declaration: 
function calculateWeight(earthWeight, planet) {
    switch (planet) {
        case 'Mercury':
            return earthWeight * .378;
        case 'Venus':
            return earthWeight * .907;
        case 'Mars':
            return earthWeight * .377;
        case 'Jupiter':
            return earthWeight * 2.36;
        case 'Saturn':
            return earthWeight * .916;
     default:
        return 'Invalid Planet Entry. Try: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn.'
    }
}
*/
console.log(calculateWeight(100, 'Jupiter'))
```

## truthyOrFalsy()



**1.**

It can be hard to keep track of
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">what’s <strong>truthy</strong> or
<strong>falsy</strong> in JavaScript</a>. Write a function,
`truthyOrFalsy()`, that takes in any value and returns `true` if that
value is **truthy** and `false` if that value is **falsy**.



``` javascript
const truthyOrFalsy = value => {
    if (value) {
        return true
    }
    return false
}

/*
// As a function declaration:
function truthyOrFalsy(value) {
    if (value) {
        return true
    } else {
        return false
    }
}

// Using a ternary: 
const truthyOrFalsy = value => value ? true : false 
*/
```

## numImaginaryFriends()



**1.**

A person’s number of imaginary friends are always 25% (or 1/4) of their
total friends.

Write a function, `numImaginaryFriends()`, that takes in the total
number of friends a person has and returns the number of imaginary
friends they have.

Since friends can only come in whole numbers, be sure to round your
result up to the nearest whole number before returning it.

The JavaScript `Math.ceil()` function will come in handy. Check out <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/ceil"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">the documentation here</a> to figure out
how it works.



``` javascript
const numImaginaryFriends = totalFriends => Math.ceil(totalFriends * .25)

/*
// As a function declaration:
function numImaginaryFriends(totalFriends) {
  return Math.ceil(totalFriends * .25)
}
*/
```

## sillySentence()



**1.**

Write a function, `sillySentence()`, that has 3 string parameters and
returns the following silly sentence with the blanks filled in by the
arguments passed into the function:

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/js-fundamentals-code-challenge/sillySentence.svg"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" />

``` js
sillySentence('excited', 'love', 'functions'); 
// Should return 'I am so excited because I love coding! Time to write some more awesome functions!'
```



``` javascript
const sillySentence = (adjective, verb, noun) => `I am so ${adjective} because I ${verb} coding! Time to write some more awesome ${noun}!`

/*
// With string concatenation:
const sillySentence = (adjective, verb, noun) => 'I am so ' + adjective + ' because I ' + verb +  ' coding! Time to write some more awesome ' + noun + '!'


// As a function declaration:
function sillySentence(adjective, verb, noun) {
    return `I am so ${adjective} because I ${verb} coding! Time to write some more awesome ${noun}!`
}
*/
```

## howOld()



**1.**

Write a function, `howOld()`, that has two number parameters, `age` and
`year`, and returns how old someone who is currently that `age` was (or
will be) during that `year`. Handle three different cases:

- If the year is in the future, you should return a string in the
  following format:

  ``` js
  'You will be [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'
  ```

- If the year is before they were born, you should return a string in
  the following format:

  ``` js
  'The year [year passed in] was [calculated number of years] years before you were born'
  ```

- If the year is in the past but not before the person was born, you
  should return a string in the following format:

  ``` js
  'You were [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'
  ```



``` javascript
/* 
Our solution is written as a function expression and uses string interpolation, but it would be equally acceptable to use a function declaration and/or string concatenation
*/

const howOld = (age, year) => {
// The following two lines make it so that our function always knows the current year.
    let dateToday = new Date();
    let thisYear = dateToday.getFullYear();
// It is totally ok if your function used the current year directly!
  
    const yearDifference = year - thisYear
    const newAge = age + yearDifference
    if (newAge > age) {
        return `You will be ${newAge} in the year ${year}`
    } else if (newAge < 0) {
        return `The year ${year} was ${-newAge} years before you were born`
    } else {

## Fix the broken code (round 2)!



**1.**

Given the percentage of DNA shared between two people, you can
<a href="https://isogg.org/wiki/Autosomal_DNA_statistics"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">calculate their likely familial
relationship</a>.

We wrote a function, `whatRelation()`, that has one number parameter,
`percentSharedDNA`, and returns the likely relationship. We expect the
number passed in to always be an integer from 0 to 100, but for some
reason it’s not working!

Here’s how it’s supposed to calculate the relationship:

- 100 should return `'You are likely identical twins.'`
- 35-99 should return
  `'You are likely parent and child or full siblings.'`
- 14-34 should return
  `'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings.'`
- 6-13 should return `'You are likely 1st cousins.'`
- 3-5 should return `'You are likely 2nd cousins.'`
- 1-2 should return `'You are likely 3rd cousins.'`
- 0 should return `'You are likely not related.'`

Unfortunately, it’s not working how we want!

``` js
whatRelation(34) 
// Should return 'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings.'
// But instead it's returning 'You are likely 1st cousins.'
 
whatRelation(3)
// Should return 'You are likely 2nd cousins.'
// But instead it's returning 'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings.'
```

Can you fix our code, please?



``` javascript
const whatRelation = percentSharedDNA => {
    if (percentSharedDNA === 100) {
        return 'You are likely identical twins.'
    }
    if (percentSharedDNA > 34) {
        return 'You are likely parent and child or full siblings.'
    }
    if (percentSharedDNA > 13) {
        return 'You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings.'
    }
    if (percentSharedDNA > 5) {
        return 'You are likely 1st cousins.'
    }
    if (percentSharedDNA > 2) {
        return 'You are likely 2nd cousins.'
    }
    if (percentSharedDNA > 0) {
        return 'You are likely 3rd cousins'
    }
    return 'You are likely not related.'
}

console.log(whatRelation(34))

console.log(whatRelation(3))
```

    ## You are likely grandparent and grandchild, aunt/uncle and niece/nephew, or half siblings.
    ## You are likely 2nd cousins.

## tipCalculator()



**1.**

Create a function, `tipCalculator()`, that has two parameters, a string
representing the `quality` of the service received and a number
representing the `total` cost.

Return the tip, as a number, based on the following:  
‘bad’ should return a 5% tip  
‘ok’ should return a 15% tip  
‘good’ should return a 20% tip  
‘excellent’ should return a 30% tip  
all other inputs should default to 18%

``` js
tipCalculator('good', 100) // Should return 20
```



``` javascript
const tipCalculator = (quality, total) => {
    switch (quality) {
        case 'bad':
            return total * .05;
        case 'ok':
            return total * .15;
        case 'good':
            return total * .20;
        case 'excellent':
            return total * .30;
        default:
            return total * .18;

    }
}
/*
// As a function declaration:
function tipCalculator(quality, total) {
    switch (quality) {
        case 'bad':
            return total * .05;
        case 'ok':
            return total * .15;
        case 'good':
            return total * .20;
        case 'excellent':
            return total * .30;
        default:
            return total * .18;

    }
}
*/
console.log(tipCalculator('good', 100))
```

    ## 20

## toEmoticon()



**1.**

Write a function, `toEmoticon()`, that takes in a string and returns the
corresponding emoticon as a string. Use a switch/case, and cover these
cases:

`'shrug'` should return `'|_{"}_|'`  
`'smiley face'` should return `':)'`  
`'frowny face'` should return`':('`  
`'winky face'` should return `';)'`  
`'heart'` should return `'<3'`  
any other input should return `'|_(* ~ *)_|'`



``` javascript
const toEmoticon = meaning => {
    switch (meaning) {
        case 'shrug':
            return '|_{"}_|'
        case 'smiley face':
            return ':)';
        case 'frowny face':
            return ':(';
        case 'winky face':
            return ';)';
        case 'heart':
            return '<3';
        default:
            return '|_(* ~ *)_|';
    }
}
/*
// As a function declaration: 
function toEmoticon(meaning) {
    switch (meaning) {
        case 'shrug':
            return '|_{"}_|'
        case 'smiley face':
            return ':)';
        case 'frowny face':
            return ':(';
        case 'winky face':
            return ';)';
        case 'heart':
            return '<3';
        default:
            return '|_(* ~ *)_|';
    }
}
*/
console.log(toEmoticon("whatever"))
```

    ## |_(* ~ *)_|

# JavaScript Practice: Data Types, Conditional, Functions

Practice JavaScript conditionals and functions with these 3 code
challenges.

In these exercises, you will practice creating JavaScript functions.
This is helpful if you want to improve your logical thought process and
practice creating functions with proper JavaScript syntax.

Some of these challenges are difficult! Take some time to think about
them before starting to code.

You might not get the solution correct on your first try — look at your
output, try to find where you’re going wrong, and iterate on your
solution.

Finally, if you get stuck, use our solution code! If you “Check Answer”
twice with an incorrect solution, you should see an option to get our
solution code. However, truly investigate that solution — experiment and
play with the solution code until you have a good grasp of how it is
working. Good luck!

# Going Off-Platform with JavaScript

Learn what it takes to run JavaScript off of Codecademy’s site!

When you come to Codecademy to learn how to code, you’re able to run
code from the start — and that’s because we’ve taken care of the
language setup process for you! Up until now, you’ve been able to focus
on learning JavaScript syntax rather than the configurations needed to
run that language outside of our site.

However, as you gain more experience and get more comfortable as a
developer, you’ll realize the need to branch out from using Codecademy
to run your code. In the upcoming articles, you’ll learn different
options for executing JavaScript code. You’ll see first-hand how to use
the browser to run JavaScript, how to install JavaScript onto your
computer, how to write JavaScript code, and how to execute JavaScript
without the browser at all!

Are you ready? Click next to find out more!

# Running JavaScript in the Browser Console

Learn how to run JavaScript code in your browser.

Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript (JS) makes up one of the core
languages in
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/web-development"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">web development</a>. JS code is normally added using the
HTML `<script>` element for executing in web browsers, but most modern
browsers also provide a console as part of their developer tools where
we can directly write and run JS, typically for testing and debugging
purposes. The console is essentially a REPL (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop</a>) that allows
us to execute JS within the context of the page, such as modifying the
page’s <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-dom/"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">DOM (</a><a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Document Object Model</a>) or logging to
the console. The console itself is also the place to view the messages
that were logged by JS code, as well as any other information that the
browser had documented, including network requests and security errors.

In this article, we’ll walk through how to open the developer console
and run JS code right in your browser!

## Opening the browser console

The steps to opening the console may be slightly different depending on
the browser you use as well as your computer’s operating system. But
generally, you should be able to bring up the developer tools by right
clicking and selecting `Inspect` or `Inspect Element`, and then navigate
to the `Console` tab from there. (If you are using Apple Safari, you
will first need to go to your `Preferences` and check the “Show Develop
menu in menu bar” option under the `Advanced` tab.) Below are some
alternative ways of bringing up the console:

We’ll be using Google Chrome for the following examples — also, feel
free to try to follow along with the examples! When you pull up the
console, you might see some messages that have been logged by the
browser, depending on what site you’re on. If you do, feel free to run
`clear()` first to clear the console.

## Example \#1: Performing basic arithmetic

Remember that the console is a REPL, so we can run JS code, such as
arithmetic expressions, by typing it after the `>` prompt and hitting
<span class="kbd">Enter</span>/<span class="kbd">Return</span>. The
expression will be evaluated, and the return value is printed to the
console on the next line following the `<` arrow:

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/running-js-in-the-browser/basic_arithmetic.png"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="basic_arithmetic" />

Similarly, we can use comparison operators to compare values, which will
evaluate to `true` or `false`:

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/running-js-in-the-browser/expression_evaluation.png"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="expression_evaluation" />

In some newer browsers, you may notice that the console displays a
preview of the return value as you’re typing, even before you hit
<span class="kbd">Enter</span>/<span class="kbd">Return</span>.

## Example \#2: Calling and writing functions

In addition to performing basic arithmetic, we can also execute any
other valid JS code, such as calling functions and methods. A list of
the built-in functions and objects that are available to use in the
console can be found in the <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDN web docs</a>. For example,
`Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number:

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/running-js-in-the-browser/calling_methods.png"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="calling_methods" />

The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code
class="code__2rdF32qjRVp7mMVBHuPwDS">console</code> object</a> can also
be accessed in the web browser’s console. Most frequently, it is used to
output text and data, such as for debugging purposes:

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/running-js-in-the-browser/console_logging.png"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="console_logging" />

Notice that two new lines appear after running the previous code, one
preceded by the `<` arrow and one without. This is because
`console.log()` simply prints the message to the console and does not
return anything. Thus, the first line we see is the logged message, and
the second line that starts with `<` is the return value, or
`undefined`.

We can also write our own functions in the console. In the example
below, we define a function called `addTwo()` which logs a message to
the console, then returns the input number plus `2`:

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/running-js-in-the-browser/defining_functions.png"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="defining_functions" />

Because the function declaration itself does not evaluate to any value,
`undefined` is returned and printed to the console after the `<` arrow.

When we call the `addTwo()` function, `Evaluating...` is first outputted
to the console from our `console.log()` call. Then, the function’s
return value—which is what the function call evaluates to—will get
printed after the `<` arrow:

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/running-js-in-the-browser/calling_function.png"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="calling_function" />

## Example \#3: Interacting with the page’s DOM

As we’ve seen so far, we can run JS in the console completely
independent of the page we have opened in the browser. But what makes
the console particularly useful is that we could also directly inspect
and modify the page’s DOM if we wanted to. Let’s look at a simple
example using a blank webpage.

To bring up a blank page, we can enter `about:blank` into the browser’s
address bar. We can confirm that there is no HTML inside the `<body>`
element of the page by checking `document.body.innerHTML` in the
console:

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/running-js-in-the-browser/inspecting_body.png"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="inspecting_body" />

We can also write JS code to modify the page’s DOM, such as adding a
heading element inside the body, as seen below. Once we run the
following code, the change will immediately be reflected on the page
opened in the browser:

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/running-js-in-the-browser/manipulating_body.png"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="manipulating_body" />

The console also recognizes <a href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery/"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code
class="code__2rdF32qjRVp7mMVBHuPwDS">\$()</code></a> as an alias for <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code
class="code__2rdF32qjRVp7mMVBHuPwDS">document.querySelector()</code></a>
to select an element. This shorthand resembles
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-jquery"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">jQuery</a> syntax and helps make manipulating the DOM
through the console even more efficient:

<img
src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/running-js-in-the-browser/aliasing_dom_selector.png"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp" alt="aliasing_dom_selector" />

In the code above, we used the shorthand `$()` syntax to select the
`<body>` element and set the `color` property to `"blue"`. This
statement returns the value `"blue"` to the console, and the color
change is immediately reflected on the webpage.

## Conclusion

As we can see, the console provides a quick and convenient way of
running any JS code in the browser, whether independent of or directly
related to the page content. If any edits are made to the page, the
changes are temporary and will be gone upon refreshing, which works
great for testing purposes when you don’t want to modify the actual
code. Combined with the other developer tools offered by browsers, we
can see how the console can quickly become an essential part of a
developer’s toolbox!

# Introduction to JavaScript Runtime Environments

An introduction to the Node runtime environment and a browser’s runtime
environment.

## What is a Runtime Environment?

A *runtime environment* is where your program will be executed. It
determines what global objects your program can access and it can also
impact how it runs. This article covers the two JavaScript runtime
environments:

1.  the runtime environment of a browser (like
    <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/"
    class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome</a>, or
    <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/"
    class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox</a>)
2.  the Node runtime environment

## A Browser’s Runtime Environment

The most common place where JavaScript code is executed is in a browser.
For example, using any
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/visual-studio-code"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">text editor</a>, you could create a file on your own
computer called **my_website.html** and put the following HTML code
inside:

``` js
<!-- my_website.html -->
<html>
  <body>
    <h1> My Website </h1>
    <script> window.alert('Hello World'); </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Save your file, then open your favorite browser. Most browsers will
allow you to load websites that you have created locally by going to the
menu File \> Open File \> **my_website.html**.

Upon loading, the embedded `<script></script>` will execute and the
`window.alert()` method will create a pop-up box in your browser with
the text `"Hello World"`. How is this possible? Where did the
`window.alert()` method come from and how can it control your browser?

The answer is that you are executing this code in the *browser’s runtime
environment*. The
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code
class="code__2rdF32qjRVp7mMVBHuPwDS">window.alert()</code></a> method is
built into this environment and any program executed in a browser has
access to this method. In fact, the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code
class="code__2rdF32qjRVp7mMVBHuPwDS">window</code></a> object provides
access to a huge amount of data and functionality relating to the open
browser window beyond just `.alert()`.

> Try replacing `window.alert()` with `window.prompt()` or
> `window.confirm()`

Applications created for and executed in the browser are known as
*front-end* applications. For a long time, JavaScript code could only be
executed in a browser and was used exclusively for creating front-end
applications. In order to create *back-end* applications that could run
on a computer WITHOUT a browser, you would need to use other programming
languages such as Java or PHP.

## The Node Runtime Environment

In 2009, the *Node runtime environment* was created for the purpose of
executing JavaScript code without a browser, thus enabling programmers
to create *full-stack* (front-end and back-end) applications using only
the JavaScript language.

Node is an entirely different runtime environment, meaning that
browser-environment data values and functions, like `window.alert()`,
can’t be used. Instead, the Node runtime environment gives back-end
applications access to a variety of features unavailable in a browser,
such as access to the server’s file system, database, and network.

For example, suppose you created a file called **my-app.js**. We can
check to see the directory that this file is located in using the Node
runtime environment variable `process`:

``` js
// my-app.js
console.log(process.env.PWD);
```

> Notice that we are using `console.log` now instead of `window.alert()`
> since the `window` object isn’t available

`process` is an object containing data relating to the JavaScript file
being executed. `process.env` is an object containing environment
variables such as `process.env.PWD` which contains the current working
directory (and stands for “**P**rint **W**orking **D**irectory”).

To execute the JavaScript code in this file, first make sure that you
have
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/setting-up-node-locally"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">set up Node on your computer</a>. Then, open up a
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">terminal</a> and run the following command:

``` js
$ node my-app.js
/path/to/working/directory
```

The `node` command tells your computer to execute the `my-app.js` file
in the Node environment. You can also use the `node` command without a
file argument to open up the Node **R**ead-**E**val-**P**rint-**L**oop
(REPL):

``` js
$ node
> process.env.HOME
'/home/ccuser'
```

## Summary

A *runtime environment* is where your program will be executed.
JavaScript code may be executed in one of two runtime environments:

1.  a browser’s runtime environment
2.  the Node runtime environment

In each of these environments, different data values and functions are
available, and these differences help distinguish front-end applications
from back-end applications.

- Front-end JavaScript applications are executed in a browser’s runtime
  environment and have access to the `window` object.
- Back-end JavaScript applications are executed in the Node runtime
  environment and have access to the file system, databases, and
  networks attached to the server.

# Setting Up Node Locally

Learn how to download Node on your local machine, so you can use the
powerful Node.js runtime from your own computer.

### What is Node?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, or an environment which runs JavaScript
code outside of the browser. A “runtime” converts code written in a
high-level, human-readable, programming language and compiles it down to
code the computer can execute. Node was created with the goal of
building web servers and web applications in JavaScript, but it’s a
powerful and flexible environment that can be used for building all
sorts of applications. Check out <a
href="https://www.codecademy.com/content-items/7e182ef11df387e8b51708a52df36515/exercises/introduction"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">our lesson on Node</a> to get to know the environment!

### Installing Node

When you’re ready, running Node on your own computer is an exciting step
towards becoming a developer. Playing on the Node REPL in your own
terminal and executing your first local JavaScript program will set you
on your way to building all sorts of exciting projects.

Before you install Node, you’ll need to make sure you have your
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-setup"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">command line set up</a>.

Navigate to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Node website</a>, and download the
version of Node labeled “LTS” on the main page. For additional download
options, such as different operating systems and versions, you can
navigate to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Node downloads page</a>.

After your download is complete, open the downloaded installation
package and follow the installation instructions.

After installation, open a new terminal window. To confirm Node was
downloaded, you can run the terminal command `which node` which will
print the filepath to Node. You can also check which version of Node you
downloaded with the `node -v` terminal command.

*Note: The current LTS version of Node.js is v14.17.1. The Node version
used in the videos below is older, but the installation process remains
the same. If the `node` command is not found, try closing and reopening
the terminal/Git Bash window.*

# Getting Started with JavaScript in VSCode

Use Visual Studio Code in your local environment and execute a
JavaScript program!

## Use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to Execute JavaScript

As you move through various lessons and paths here on Codecademy, you
may find yourself needing to create a project on your own computer and
not on the Codecademy learning environment. This can be tricky, but it’s
an exciting step that signals that you are ready to work independently.

To do this, we’ll need to use the text editor we installed above. Let’s
take a moment to try out Visual Studio Code.

Part of becoming a skillful developer is being able to work on your own
computer to create apps and programs. In this article, you’ll write
JavaScript code in VSCode and execute it to see the output.

### Pre-requisites

Before getting started, please make sure that you have installed the
following:

- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"
  class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">VSCode</a> - this is the text editor
  we’ll be working with.
- <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/setting-up-node-locally"
  class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
  target="_blank">Node</a> - is a runtime environment that will execute
  our JavaScript program.

### Development Folders

If you haven’t already set up a dedicated folder for your coding
projects, now is a good time to start. It’s important to establish an
organized file system especially as the number and size of your projects
grow. The program we’re creating for this article will be small, but
again, it’s a good habit to build.

One convention is naming this directory **projects**. It will store all
of your coding projects. Whenever you create a new project, no matter
how small, you should always make a new folder inside your **projects**
directory. You will find that single-file projects can quickly turn into
large, multi-folder projects.

### Creating our JavaScript program

Below are the steps you need to follow to create a “Hello, World!”
JavaScript program.

#### 1. Make a New Folder for this Program

Navigate to your **projects** folder using your file manager or the
terminal. Then inside the folder, create a new folder called
**helloJavaScript**. This folder will store the file(s) that you’ll
need.

#### 2. Open Visual Studio Code

#### 3. Open Your New Project’s Folder

Click on the ‘Explorer’ icon on the left-hand menu and click on the
button ‘Open Folder’ and choose your development folder. This will
launch your file manager.

Navigate to the **helloJavaScript** folder and select Open. The folder
will open in Visual Studio Code’s side pane. At this point, there should
not be any contents in the folder. We’ll add a file in the next step.

#### 4. Add a File.

In Visual Studio Code’s Explorer pane, click on your development
folder’s name. You’ll see four icons appear to the right of the folder
name. Click the ‘New File’ icon. Type in the name of what you want to
name your file with the correct file extension. It’s good practice to
name the file something that matches the purpose of that file. In this
case, you should name the file something like, **hello.js**. Press Enter
when done.

#### 5. Begin coding!

Copy and paste the following boilerplate JavaScript code (or add your
own JavaScript code):

``` js
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

Save your file often with the Auto Save feature and track changes with a
version control system if you know how to use one. (To turn Auto Save
on, click on ‘File’ then ‘Auto Save’. When it’s on, you’ll see a
checkmark next to ‘Auto Save’.) This will decrease the chances of losing
unsaved work.

If your file has the right extension **.js** and your code has no syntax
errors, you should see the correct syntax highlighting in VSCode!

Here’s what your file in VSCode should look like:

<img
src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/javascript-local/hello_js_app_screenshot.png"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="JavaScript code of `console.log(&#39;Hello, World!&#39;);` is written in a JavaScript file in VSCode code with full syntax highlighting" />

#### 6. Use Node to Run Your Program

At this point, your program can be executed by Node!

You can use your terminal or VSCode’s built-in terminal to run the
command:

``` js
node hello.js
```

Here’s how it could look if you’re using your terminal:

<img
src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/javascript-local/terminal_execution.png"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="screenshot of the terminal showing the folder, `helloJavaScript` with the command `node hello.js` and a print out of &quot;Hello, World!&quot;" />

How’s how it could look like if you’re using
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">VSCode’s built-in terminal</a>:

<img
src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/javascript-local/vscode_hello.png"
class="img__1JGFO2nlisObc3KeOSGPRp"
alt="screenshot of VSCode&#39;s terminal showing the folder, `helloJavaScript` with the command `node hello.js` and a print out of &quot;Hello, World!&quot;" />

If you’re not seeing the correct results, make sure that you’re in the
correct folder in your terminal and that you’ve typed in the correct
name of your file.

## Wrapping up

Congratulations, you’ve successfully used VSCode to log out
`"Hello, World!"` the quintessential program for getting started! As you
develop more, you’ll be able to create more robust programs and apps —
straight from your own computer!

# Challenge Project: Number Guesser

#### Overview

This project is slightly different from others you have encountered thus
far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project
contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project
you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill
all of these requirements, and you should expect to use Codecademy, the
internet, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you
cannot easily solve. In order to complete this project, you should have
completed the first three sections of
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">Introduction to JavaScript</a> through Learn JavaScript:
Functions.

#### Project Goals

In this project, you’ll write JavaScript functions to power a small
guessing game. Your code will run in the browser instead of the
terminal, and you can use your browser’s console to help you test your
functions and view any syntax errors.

#### Project Requirements

In this project, you’ll write four functions in **script.js**. We’ve
provided some additional JavaScript code in **game.js** that will call
your functions based on user interactions, but you don’t need to look at
**game.js** and shouldn’t edit it if you want your project to work as
intended. As you complete this project, make sure that all of your
functions are named exactly as specified within these tasks so that they
can be called correctly when the game is played. In this project, your
JavaScript functions are incorporated into a website that also uses
HTML/CSS. You’ll learn more about how to do this from scratch as you
continue your JavaScript journey. Explore the <a
href="https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/number-guesser/example/index.html"

target="_blank" rel="noopener">completed version</a> of the project to
get a sense of what you’ll be building.

#### Setup Instructions

If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy,
you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button
below. You’ll need to open and work in **script.js** in a text editor,
and open **index.html** in a browser to test your code. If you need help
setting up on your own computer, read our

Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off

1\.

Create a `generateTarget()` function. This function should return a
random integer between 0 and 9.

The purpose of this function is to be called at the start of each new
round in order to generate the new secret target number.

2\.

Create a `compareGuesses()` function. This function:

- Has three parameters representing the user (human) guess, a computer
  guess, and the secret target number to be guessed.
- Determines which player (human or computer) wins based on which guess
  is closest to the target. If both players are tied, the human user
  should win.
- Return `true` if the human player wins, and `false` if the computer
  player wins.

The purpose of this function is to be called each round to determine
which guess is closest to the target number.

3\.

Create an `updateScore()` function. This function:

- Has a single parameter. This parameter will be a string value
  representing the winner.
- Increases the score variable (`humanScore` or `computerScore`) by 1
  depending on the winner passed in to `updateScore`. The string passed
  in will be either `'human'` or `'computer'`.
- Does not need to return any value.

The purpose of this function is to be used to correctly increase the
winner’s score after each round.

4\.

Create an `advanceRound()` function. This function should increase the
value of `currentRoundNumber` by 1.

The purpose of this function is to be used to update the round number
after each round.

After completing `advanceRound()`, your Number Guesser game should be
fully operational. You should be able to make guesses, see your or the
computer score increase correctly, move to the next round, and see the
correct round displayed.

5\.

Test that your code is working properly by invoking your newly written
functions within **script.js** with sample inputs. You can delete this
code once you’re convinced that everything is working as it should.

6\.

Great work! If you’d like to see the solution, move to the next task. If
you’d like to extend your project on your own, you could consider the
following:

- You probably calculated the distance from the computer guess to the
  target and from the human guess to the target. Move this into a
  separate `getAbsoluteDistance()` function that takes two numbers and
  returns the distance, and then use that inside your `compareGuesses()`
  function.
- Add functionality to check whether the user guess is between 0 and 9
  and `alert()` the user that their number is out of range. It’s not
  possible to set a number outside this range with the `+` and `=`
  buttons, but users can do so by typing directly in the input field.
