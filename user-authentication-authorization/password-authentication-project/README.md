# Dognation : learn authentication with CodeAcademy

Dognation is a little side project included in the fullstack engineer path.
By coding this project, you'll learn how to use express-session, passport.js and brcrypt.js to put authentication of a fake dog lover app.

There was some mistakes and confusions in the project statement, so I decided to host it on GitHub to give some feedback for future learners.

**If you want to learn some code basics, try one of the CodeAcadey path. It's a great way to start and go deeper in the code then !** 

## Feedback is welcome! =)
