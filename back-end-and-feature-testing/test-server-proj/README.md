## Quote Keeper: Server Layer Project on Codecademy

In this project, we will write the server tests for a web application that allows users to save and display a collection of their favorite quotes. We will call this app “Quote Keeper”.

The app currently has a feature level test which submits a quote, source, and who it is attributed to. It then asserts that it is displayed to the user.

Since the existing tests were solely at the feature level, it was unable to pass. We are diving into the server level.
