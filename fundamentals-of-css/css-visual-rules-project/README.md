# Olivia Woodruff Portfolio

In this project, you’ll use your knowledge of CSS visual rules to create
rule sets and improve the appearance of a photography portfolio site!

If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced
developer work through it, click “**Get Unstuck**“ to see a **project

Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off

1\.

Look over **index.html** to review the different HTML elements you have
to work with, then navigate to **style.css**.

Start by making the header section stand out a bit more. Select the
`.header` element, and make its background color `CornflowerBlue` by
using the `background-color` property.

2\.

Now change how the text is aligned in the top `.header` section.

In your `.header` rule set, align the text in the center using the
`text-align` property.

3\.

Next, use CSS to make the paragraph below Olivia’s name have a larger
text size.

In **style.css**, select the `.about-me` element, and set its
`font-size` property to `20px`.

4\.

The `.about-me` paragraph looks a little dark against the light blue
background, maybe it would look nice if it blended more with the
background.

Within the `.about-me` selector, use the `opacity` property to make it
50% transparent.

5\.

In the Projects section, make the section titles bold.

Select the `.title` elements, and add a `font-weight` property to make
their text bold.

6\.

Change the main title color so that it matches the background color more
nicely. Set the `color` for `h1` elements to `Azure`.

7\.

Instead of the page being in the default Times font, change the font of
the entire page.

Select the `body` element and make the `font-family` of the page
`Georgia`.

8\.

Finally, let’s make the background of the page more interesting.

Within the `body` selector, set the `background-image` property to this
URL:

``` html

```

9\.

Great work! Feel free to keep coding and edit the visual rules to
personalize the site’s appearance!
