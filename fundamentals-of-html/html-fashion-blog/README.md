# Fashion Blog

Your friend Isa is a budding fashion blogger, and she’s asked you to
build her a new website, just in time for New York Fashion Week!

Use your new HTML knowledge to create the underlying structure of the
blog. Make sure to include plenty of pictures, links, lists, and other
HTML elements that you’ve learned so that her fans have plenty to read.

You can view a <a

class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">completed project</a> and see how it
compares to your work!

If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced
developer work through it, click “**Get Unstuck**“ to see a **project
walkthrough video**.



Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off

1\.

To start, add the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration as the very first line
of code at the top of the `index.html` file. Add the `<html>` element
below.

2\.

Below the `<html>` opening tag, add a `<head>` element. Below the
`<head>` element, add the `<body>` element.

3\.

Within the `<head>` tags, add a `<title>` element. Title the website
“Everyday with Isa”.

4\.

Directly below the opening `<body>` tag, add an `<h1>` that says:

“An Insider’s Guide to NYFW”

Below that, add an `<h2>` that says:

“Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows”

Below that, add an `<h2>` that says:

“Dressing for the Shows”

5\.

Here’s Isa’s first dispatch from Fashion Week! Let’s add a blog post.
Between the `<h1>` and first `<h2>` tag, add a `<p>` tag that says:

“NYFW can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially if
you’ve never been. Luckily, I’m here to give you an insider’s guide and
make your first show a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips and
tricks, and following your gut, you’ll have an unforgettable
experience!”

6\.

Between the first and second `<h2>` tags, add another paragraph to the
post using the `<p>` tag:

“If you’re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag.
But I wasn’t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I’m here to help
you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make
a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you’re worrying about
blowing your cash the whole time you won’t have fun. Then check out
prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see
most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!”

7\.

After the last `<h2>` tag, add a final paragraph that says:

“Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don’t you’ll be
uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about
expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to
express through their new lines. Also it’s important to wear shoes
you’ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but
you’ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.”

8\.

Of course, this wouldn’t be a fashion blog without some images. Above
each paragraph, add an `<img>` tag and set its `src` to be one of the
following links:

``` html
https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-one.jpeg
```

``` html
https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-two.jpeg
```

``` html
https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/image-three.jpeg
```

9\.

Your first blog post is complete! Now let’s add an image of Isa, so her
readers get to know her. Below the opening body tag, add an `<img>` tag
with the following source:

``` html
https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/elements-and-structure/profile.jpg
```

10\.

Below the `<img>` tag, add an `<h3>` that says “by Isabelle Rodriguez \|
1 day ago”

11\.

Isa wants her readers to know that she’s written a lot more than one
post. Let’s make a list of some related blog posts. Beneath the last
paragraph, add a `<h4>` tag that says “Related Content”. Underneath that
header tag, create an unordered list.

12\.

The unordered list should have the following four items:

- “How To Style Boyfriend Jeans”
- “When Print Is Too Much”
- “The Overalls Trend”
- “Fall’s It Color: Blush”

13\.

Let’s get Isa’s blog connected to the rest of the web! In the first
paragraph, turn ‘NYFW’ into a link and have it go to:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week</a>.

Make sure to include the `target="_blank"` attribute so that it opens in
a new page.

14\.

Isa wants to make sure that her friends can get in touch with her. At
the bottom of your body, add a new `<div>` and set its `id='contact'`.
Inside the `<div>`, create a new `<p>` tag and put the following contact
information inside of it:

email: <a href="mailto:isa@fashionblog.com"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank">isa@fashionblog.com</a> \| phone: 917-555-1098 \|
address: 371 284th St, New York, NY, 10001

15\.

Inside the contact `<div>`, put `<strong>` opening and closing tags
around “email”, “phone”, and “address”.

16\.

Let’s make the profile picture a link to the contact section of the
webpage. Find the profile `<img>` tag, and surround it by opening and
closing `<a>` tags. In the `<a>` tag, set `href="#contact"`.

17\.

Congrats! You’ve got the beginnings of a solid fashion blog. Feel free
to make modifications and practice your HTML by adding more content.
