There are three encryption methods provided by this service:

A “Caesar Cipher” in which the characters of the input message are shifted alphabetically by a given amount.
A “Symbol Cipher” in which select characters from the input message are replaced with visually similar symbols.
A “Reverse Cipher” in which each word of the input message is reversed in place.
To use this service, run the command below:

node message-mixer.js ['caesar'|'symbol'|'reverse'] [amount]

At present, Message Mixer Inc. sells their encryption service as a program in a single file called message-mixer.js. This single file includes:
-The functions that perform the encryptions listed above.
-The code for retrieving the user input.
-The code for displaying the output back to the user.
Message Mixer Inc. now wants to join the open-source community by packaging its encryption functions 
in a module and allowing other developers to import these encryption functions into their own projects.

In this project, you will help Message Mixer Inc. extract and isolate its encryption functions into a module, 
called encryptors.js, and then refactor message-mixer.js to use this module’s functions.
